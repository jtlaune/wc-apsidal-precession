  abstract = {The gravitational-wave signal GW190521 is consistent with a binary black hole (BBH) merger source at redshift 0.8 with unusually high component masses, M {$\odot$} and M {$\odot$}, compared to previously reported events, and shows mild evidence for spin-induced orbital precession. The primary falls in the mass gap predicted by (pulsational) pair-instability supernova theory, in the approximate range 65\textendash 120 M {$\odot$}. The probability that at least one of the black holes in GW190521 is in that range is 99.0\%. The final mass of the merger ( M {$\odot$}) classifies it as an intermediate-mass black hole. Under the assumption of a quasi-circular BBH coalescence, we detail the physical properties of GW190521's source binary and its post-merger remnant, including component masses and spin vectors. Three different waveform models, as well as direct comparison to numerical solutions of general relativity, yield consistent estimates of these properties. Tests of strong-field general relativity targeting the merger-ringdown stages of the coalescence indicate consistency of the observed signal with theoretical predictions. We estimate the merger rate of similar systems to be . We discuss the astrophysical implications of GW190521 for stellar collapse and for the possible formation of black holes in the pair-instability mass gap through various channels: via (multiple) stellar coalescences, or via hierarchical mergers of lower-mass black holes in star clusters or in active galactic nuclei. We find it to be unlikely that GW190521 is a strongly lensed signal of a lower-mass black hole binary merger. We also discuss more exotic possible sources for GW190521, including a highly eccentric black hole binary, or a primordial black hole binary.},

  abstract = {We investigate the origins of Kepler-419, a peculiar system hosting two nearly coplanar and highly eccentric gas giants with apsidal orientations liberating around anti-alignment, and use this system to place constraints on the properties of their birth protoplanetary disc. We follow the proposal by Petrovich, Wu, \& Ali-Dib that these planets have been placed on these orbits as a natural result of the precessional effects of a dissipating massive disc and extend it by using direct N-body simulations and models for the evolution of the gas discs, including photoevaporation. Based on a parameter space exploration, we find that in order to reproduce the system the initial disc mass had to be at least 95 MJup and dissipate on a time-scale of at least 104 yr. This mass is consistent with the upper end of the observed disc masses distribution, and the dissipation time-scale is consistent with photoevaporation models. We study the properties of such discs using simplified 1D thin-disc models and show that they are gravitationally stable, indicating that the two planets must have formed via core accretion and thus prone to disc migration. We hence finally investigate the sensitivity of this mechanism to the outer planet's semimajor axis, and find that the nearby 7:1, 8:1, and 9:1 mean-motion resonances can completely quench this mechanism, while even higher order resonances can also significantly affect the system. Assuming the two planets avoid these high-order resonances and close encounters, the dynamics seems to be rather insensitive to planet c semimajor axis, and thus orbital migration driven by the disc.},

  abstract = {We introduce the Disk Substructures at High Angular Resolution Project (DSHARP), one of the initial Large Programs conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The primary goal of DSHARP is to find and characterize substructures in the spatial distributions of solid particles for a sample of 20 nearby protoplanetary disks, using very high resolution ({$\sim$}0. 035, or 5 au, FWHM) observations of their 240 GHz (1.25 mm) continuum emission. These data provide a first homogeneous look at the small-scale features in disks that are directly relevant to the planet formation process, quantifying their prevalence, morphologies, spatial scales, spacings, symmetry, and amplitudes, for targets with a variety of disk and stellar host properties. We find that these substructures are ubiquitous in this sample of large, bright disks. They are most frequently manifested as concentric, narrow emission rings and depleted gaps, although large-scale spiral patterns and small arc-shaped azimuthal asymmetries are also present in some cases. These substructures are found at a wide range of disk radii (from a few au to more than 100 au), are usually compact ( 10 au), and show a wide range of amplitudes (brightness contrasts). Here we discuss the motivation for the project, describe the survey design and the sample properties, detail the observations and data calibration, highlight some basic results, and provide a general overview of the key conclusions that are presented in more detail in a series of accompanying articles. The DSHARP data \textendash{} including visibilities, images, calibration scripts, and more \textendash{} are released for community use at https://almascience.org/alma-data/lp/DSHARP.},

  abstract = {The disks that orbit young stars are the essential conduits and reservoirs of material for star and planet formation. Their structures, meaning the spatial variations of the disk physical conditions, reflect the underlying mechanisms that drive those formation processes. Observations of the solids and gas in these disks, particularly at high resolution, provide fundamental insights on their mass distributions, dynamical states, and evolutionary behaviors. Over the past decade, rapid developments in these areas have largely been driven by observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). This review highlights the state of observational research on disk structures, emphasizing three key conclusions that reflect the main branches of the field: (1) Relationships among disk structure properties are also linked to the masses, environments, and evolutionary states of their stellar hosts; (2) There is clear, qualitative evidence for the growth and migration of disk solids, although the implied evolutionary timescales suggest the classical assumption of a smooth gas disk is inappropriate; and (3) Small-scale substructures with a variety of morphologies, locations, scales, and amplitudes \textendash{} presumably tracing local gas pressure maxima \textendash{} broadly influence the physical and observational properties of disks. The last point especially is reshaping the field, with the recognition that these disk substructures likely trace active sites of planetesimal growth or are the hallmarks of planetary systems at their formation epoch.},

  abstract = {Multiple pieces of evidence suggest that neutron stars receive large kicks when formed from the remnant of a collapsing star. However, the evidence for whether black holes (BH) receive natal kicks is less clear, reliant on weak constraints from the analysis of BH X-ray binaries and massive runaway and walkaway stars. Here we show for the first time that recent microlensing detections offer a new method for measuring the kicks BHs receive at birth. When a BH is identified through both photometric and astrometric microlensing and when the lensed star has a known distance and proper motion, the mass, distance and proper motion of the BH can be determined. We study the runaway velocities for components of eccentric binaries disrupted during a supernova, finding the peculiar velocity correlates strongly with the kick a BH received a birth, typically within 20\%, even when the natal kick is smaller than the orbital velocity. Therefore, by measuring the peculiar velocity of a BH or other compact object that formed from a binary that disrupted during core collapse, we are in effect measuring the natal kick that object received. We focus on MOA-2011-BLG-191/OGLE-2011-BLG-0462, an isolated, single BH detected by microlensing and consider a range of possible formation scenarios, including its formation from the disruption of a binary during a supernova event. We determine that MOA-2011-BLG-191/OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 has a Milky Way orbit consistent with a thick disk population, but if it were formed within the kinematic thin disk it received a natal kick 100 km s{$^{-1}$}.},

  abstract = {Aims: Many extrasolar systems possessing planets in mean-motion resonance or resonant chain have been discovered to date. The transit method coupled with transit timing variation analysis provides an insight into the physical and orbital parameters of the systems, but suffers from observational limitations. When a (near-)resonant planetary system resides in the dynamical neighbourhood of a stable periodic orbit, its long-term stability, and thus survival, can be guaranteed. We use the intrinsic property of the periodic orbits, namely their linear horizontal and vertical stability, to validate or further constrain the orbital elements of detected two-planet systems. Methods: We computed the families of periodic orbits in the general three-body problem for several two-planet Kepler and K2 systems. The dynamical neighbourhood of the systems is unveiled with maps of dynamical stability. Results: Additional validations or constraints on the orbital elements of K2-21, K2-24, Kepler-9, and (non-coplanar) Kepler-108 near-resonant systems were achieved. While a mean-motion resonance locking protects the long-term evolution of the systems K2-21 and K2-24, such a resonant evolution is not possible for the Kepler-9 system, whose stability is maintained through an apsidal anti-alignment. For the Kepler-108 system, we find that the stability of its mutually inclined planets could be justified either solely by a mean-motion resonance, or in tandem with an inclination-type resonance. Going forward, dynamical analyses based on periodic orbits could yield better constrained orbital elements of near-resonant extrasolar systems when performed in parallel to the fitting of the observational data.},

Turning to solids, I review the evolution of single particles under aerodynamic forces, and describe the conditions necessary for the development of collective gas-particle instabilities. Observations show that disks can exhibit pronounced large-scale structure, and I discuss the types of structures that may form from gas and particle interactions at ice lines, vortices and zonal flows, prior to the formation of large planetary bodies.

  abstract = {The orbital distribution of exoplanets indicates an accumulation of compact Super-Earth sized planetary systems close to their host stars. Assuming an inward disc-driven migration scenario for their formation, these planets could have been stopped and eventually parked at an inner edge of the disc, or be pushed through the inner disc cavity by a resonant chain. This topic has not been properly and extensively studied. Using numerical simulations we investigate how much the inner planets in a resonant chain can be pushed into the disc inner cavity by outer planets. We perform hydrodynamical and N-body simulations of planetary systems embedded in their nascent disc. The inner edge of the disc is represented in two different ways, resembling either a dead zone (DZ) inner edge or a disc inner boundary (IB), where the main difference lies in the steepness of the surface density profile. The innermost planet has always a mass of 10 M\_Earth, with equal or higher mass additional outer planets. A steeper profile is able to stop a chain of planets more efficiently than a shallower profile. The final configurations in our DZ models are usually tighter than in their IB counterparts, and therefore more prone to instability. We derive analytical expressions for the stopping conditions based on power equilibrium, and show that the final eccentricities result from torque equilibrium. For planets in thinner discs, we found, for the first time, clear signs for overstable librations in the hydrodynamical simulations, leading to very compact systems. We also found that the popular N-body simulations may overestimate the number of planets in the disc inner cavity.},

  abstract = {The most accurate method for modelling planetary migration and hence the formation of resonant systems is using hydrodynamical simulations. Usually, the force (torque) acting on a planet is calculated using the forces from the gas disc and the star, while the gas accelerations are computed using the pressure gradient, the star, and the planet's gravity, ignoring its own gravity. For the non-migrating the neglect of the disc gravity results in a consistent torque calculation while for the migrating case it is inconsistent. We aim to study how much this inconsistent torque calculation can affect the final configuration of a two-planet system. Our focus will be on low-mass planets because most of the multi-planetary systems, discovered by the Kepler survey, have masses around 10 Earth masses. Performing hydrodynamical simulations of planet-disc interaction, we measure the torques on non-migrating and migrating planets for various disc masses as well as density and temperature slopes with and without considering the disc self-gravity. Using this data, we find a relation that quantifies the inconsistency, use it in an N-body code, and perform an extended parameter study modelling the migration of a planetary system with different planet mass ratios and disc surface densities, in order to investigate the impact of the torque inconsistency on the architecture of the planetary system. Not considering disc self-gravity produces an artificially larger torque on the migrating planet that can result in tighter planetary systems. The deviation of this torque from the correct value is larger in discs with steeper surface density profiles. In hydrodynamical modelling of multi-planetary systems, it is crucial to account for the torque correction, otherwise the results favour more packed systems.},

Such a diversity originates from (1) the level of viscous transport in the disk which determines the number of gaps a planet can open; (2) the size and spatial distributions of grains determined by the coagulation, fragmentation, and radial drift, which in turn affects the emmisivity of the disk at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths; and (3) the angular resolution used to observe the disk. In particular, our results show that disks having the same underlying gas distribution can have very different grain size/spatial distributions and thus appearance in continuum, depending on the interplay among coagulation, fragmentation, and radial drift. This suggests that proper treatments for the grain growth have to be included in models of protoplanetary disks concerning continuum properties and that complementary molecular line observations are highly desired in addition to continuum observations to reveal the true nature of disks. The fact that a single planet can produce diverse disk morphology emphasizes the need to search for more direct, localized signatures of planets in order to confirm (or dispute) the planetary origin of observed ringed substructures.},

This has been well studied using both linear theory and numerical simulations, but so far, only for the primary spiral arm \textendash{} the one directly attached to the planet. Using two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we show that the secondary and tertiary arms driven by a planet can also open gaps as they steepen into shocks. The depths of the secondary/tertiary gaps in surface density grow with time in a low viscosity disk (\$\textbackslash alpha = 5\textbackslash times10\textasciicircum\{-5\}\$), so even low-mass planets (e.g., super-Earth or mini-Neptune-mass) embedded in the disk can open multiple observable gaps, provided that sufficient time has passed. Applying our results to the HL Tau disk, we show that a single 30 Earth-mass planet embedded in the ring at 68.8\textasciitilde au (B5) can reasonably well reproduce the positions of the two major gaps at 13.2 and 32.3 au (D1 and D2), and roughly reproduce two other major gaps at 64.2 and 74.7 au (D5 and D6) seen in the mm continuum. The positions of secondary/tertiary gaps are found to be sensitive to the planetary mass and the disk temperature profile, so with accurate observational measurements of the temperature structure the positions of multiple gaps can be used to constrain the mass of the planet. We also comment on the gaps seen in the TW Hya and HD\textasciitilde 163296 disk.},

  abstract = {Protoplanetary disk simulations show that a single planet can excite more than one spiral arm, possibly explaining recent observations of multiple spiral arms in some systems. In this paper, we explain the mechanism by which a planet excites multiple spiral arms in a protoplanetary disk. Contrary to previous speculations, the formation of both primary and additional arms can be understood as a linear process when the planet mass is sufficiently small. A planet resonantly interacts with epicyclic oscillations in the disk, launching spiral wave modes around the Lindblad resonances. When a set of wave modes is in phase, they can constructively interfere with each other and create a spiral arm. More than one spiral arm can form because such constructive interference can occur for different sets of wave modes, with the exact number and launching position of spiral arms dependent on the planet mass as well as the disk temperature profile. Non-linear effects become increasingly important as the planet mass increases, resulting in spiral arms with stronger shocks and thus larger pitch angles. This is found in common for both primary and additional arms. When a planet has a sufficiently large mass (\$\textbackslash gtrsim\$ 3 thermal masses for \$(h/r)\_p=0.1\$), only two spiral arms form interior to its orbit. The wave modes that would form a tertiary arm for smaller mass planets merge with the primary arm. Improvements in our understanding of the formation of spiral arms can provide crucial insights into the origin of observed spiral arms in protoplanetary disks.},

By carrying out two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations varying planet mass and disk gas temperature, we find that a larger number of spiral arms form with a smaller planet mass and a lower disk temperature. A planet excites two or more spiral arms interior to its orbit for a range of disk temperature characterized by the disk aspect ratio \$0.04\textbackslash leq(h/r)\_p\textbackslash leq0.15\$, whereas exterior to a planet's orbit multiple spiral arms can form only in cold disks with \$(h/r)\_p \textbackslash lesssim 0.06\$. Constraining the planet mass with the pitch angle of spiral arms requires accurate disk temperature measurements that might be challenging even with ALMA. However, the property that the pitch angle of planet-driven spiral arms decreases away from the planet can be a powerful diagnostic to determine whether the planet is located interior or exterior to the observed spirals. The arm-to-arm separations increase as a function of planet mass, consistent with previous studies; however, the exact slope depends on disk temperature as well as the radial location where the arm-to-arm separations are measured. We apply these diagnostics to the spiral arms seen in MWC 758 and Elias 2-27. As shown in Bae et al. (2017), planet-driven spiral arms can create concentric rings and gaps, which can produce more dominant observable signature than spiral arms under certain circumstances. We discuss the observability of planet-driven spiral arms versus rings and gaps.},

Our particle-gas hybrid scheme is based on a second order predictor-corrector method. Careful treatment of the momentum feedback on the gas guarantees exact conservation. The hybrid scheme is stable and convergent in most regimes relevant to protoplanetary disks. We describe a semi-implicit integrator generalized from the leap-frog approach. In the absence of drag force, it preserves the geometric properties of a particle orbit. We also present a fully-implicit integrator that is unconditionally stable for all regimes of particle-gas coupling. Using our hybrid code, we study the numerical convergence of the non-linear saturated state of the streaming instability. We find that gas flow properties are well converged with modest grid resolution (128 cells per pressure length \textbackslash eta r for dimensionless stopping time tau\_s=0.1), and equal number of particles and grid cells. On the other hand, particle clumping properties converge only at higher resolutions, and finer resolution leads to stronger clumping before convergence is reached. Finally, we find that measurement of particle transport properties resulted from the streaming instability may be subject to error of about 20\%.},

The particles are coupled to gas aerodynamically, with particle-to-gas feedback included. Magnetorotational turbulence is ignored as an approximation for the dead zone of PPDs, and we ignore particle self-gravity to study the precursor of planetesimal formation. Our simulations include a wide size distribution of particles, ranging from strongly coupled particles with dimensionless stopping time tau\_s=Omega t\_stop=1e-4 to marginally coupled ones with tau\_s=1 (where Omega is the orbital frequency, t\_stop is the particle friction time), and a wide range of solid abundances. Our main results are: 1. Particles with tau\_s{$>$}=0.01 actively participate in the streaming instability, generate turbulence and maintain the height of the particle layer before Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is triggered. 2. Strong particle clumping as a consequence of the streaming instability occurs when a substantial fraction of the solids are large (tau\_s{$>$}=0.01) and when height-integrated solid to gas mass ratio Z is super-solar. 3. The radial drift velocity is reduced relative to the conventional Nakagawa-Sekiya-Hayashi (NSH) model, especially at high Z. We derive a generalized NSH equilibrium solution for multiple particle species which fits our results very well. 4. Collision velocity between particles with tau\_s{$>$}=0.01 is dominated by differential radial drift, and is strongly reduced at larger Z. 5. There exist two positive feedback loops with respect to the enrichment of local disk solid abundance and grain growth. All these effects promote planetesimal formation.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone a renaissance recently, making major progress in key domains such as vision, language, control, and decision-making. This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute resources, which have fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many defining characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under much different pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches. In particular, generalizing beyond one's experiences\textendash a hallmark of human intelligence from infancy\textendash remains a formidable challenge for modern AI. The following is part position paper, part review, and part unification. We argue that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for AI to achieve human-like abilities, and that structured representations and computations are key to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature and nurture cooperatively, we reject the false choice between "hand-engineering" and "end-to-end" learning, and instead advocate for an approach which benefits from their complementary strengths. We explore how using relational inductive biases within deep learning architectures can facilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for composing them. We present a new building block for the AI toolkit with a strong relational inductive bias\textendash the graph network\textendash which generalizes and extends various approaches for neural networks that operate on graphs, and provides a straightforward interface for manipulating structured knowledge and producing structured behaviors. We discuss how graph networks can support relational reasoning and combinatorial generalization, laying the foundation for more sophisticated, interpretable, and flexible patterns of reasoning.

While the origin of such systems is attributed to protoplanetary disk-driven migration, a qualitative description of the dynamical evolution of resonant planets remains largely elusive. Aided by the pioneering works of the last century, we formulate an approximate, integrable theory for first-order resonant motion. We utilize the developed theory to construct an intuitive, geometrical representation of resonances within the context of the unrestricted three-body problem. Moreover, we derive a simple analytical criterion for the appearance of secondary resonances between resonant and secular motion. Subsequently, we demonstrate the onset of rapid chaotic motion as a result of overlap among neighboring first-order mean-motion resonances, as well as the appearance of slow chaos as a result of secular modulation of the planetary orbits. Finally, we take advantage of the integrable theory to analytically show that, in the adiabatic regime, divergent encounters with first-order mean-motion resonances always lead to persistent apsidal anti-alignment.},

  abstract = {The early stages of dynamical evolution of planetary systems are often shaped by dissipative processes that drive orbital migration. In multi-planet systems, convergent amassing of orbits inevitably leads to encounters with rational period ratios, which may result in establishment of mean motion resonances. The success or failure of resonant capture yields exceedingly different subsequent evolutions, and thus plays a central role in determining the ensuing orbital architecture of planetary systems. In this work, we employ an integrable Hamiltonian formalism for first order planetary resonances that allows both secondary bodies to have finite masses and eccentricities, and construct a comprehensive theory for resonant capture. Particularly, we derive conditions under which orbital evolution lies within the adiabatic regime, and provide a generalized criterion for guaranteed resonant locking as well as a procedure for calculating capture probabilities when capture is not certain. Subsequently, we utilize the developed analytical model to examine the evolution of Jupiter and Saturn within the protosolar nebula, and investigate the origins of the dominantly non-resonant orbital distribution of sub-Jovian extrasolar planets. Our calculations show that the commonly observed extrasolar orbital structure can be understood if planet pairs encounter mean motion commensurabilities on slightly eccentric (e\textasciitilde 0.02) orbits. Accordingly, we speculate that resonant capture among low-mass planets is typically rendered unsuccessful due to subtle axial asymmetries inherent to the global structure of protoplanetary disks.},

In this work we show that the orbits of distant Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) cluster not only in argument of perihelion, but also in physical space. We demonstrate that the perihelion positions and orbital planes of the objects are tightly confined and that such a clustering has only a probability of 0.007\% to be due to chance, thus requiring a dynamical origin. We find that the observed orbital alignment can be maintained by a distant eccentric planet with mass {$\greaterequivlnt$}10 m {$\oplus$} whose orbit lies in approximately the same plane as those of the distant KBOs, but whose perihelion is 180\textdegree{} away from the perihelia of the minor bodies. In addition to accounting for the observed orbital alignment, the existence of such a planet naturally explains the presence of high-perihelion Sedna-like objects, as well as the known collection of high semimajor axis objects with inclinations between 60\textdegree{} and 150\textdegree{} whose origin was previously unclear. Continued analysis of both distant and highly inclined outer solar system objects provides the opportunity for testing our hypothesis as well as further constraining the orbital elements and mass of the distant planet.},

These planets have masses that typically exceed that of the Earth by a factor of a few; appear to be predominantly rocky, although often surrounded by H/He atmospheres; and frequently occur in multiples. Moreover, planets that encircle the same star tend to have similar masses and radii, whereas those belonging to different systems exhibit remarkable overall diversity. Here, we advance a theoretical picture for rocky planet formation that satisfies the aforementioned constraints: building upon recent work - which demonstrates that planetesimals can form rapidly at discrete locations in the disk - we propose that super-Earths originate inside rings of silicate-rich planetesimals at approximately \textasciitilde 1 AU. Within the context of this picture, we show that planets grow primarily through pairwise collisions among rocky planetesimals, until they achieve terminal masses that are regulated by isolation and orbital migration. We quantify our model with numerical simulations and demonstrate that our synthetic planetary systems bear a close resemblance to compact, multi-resonant progenitors of the observed population of short-period extrasolar planets. Our results thus indicate that the absence of short-period super-Earths within the solar system can simply be attributed to the comparatively low mass of the primordial planetesimal ring within the protosolar nebula.},

The 1/2, 2/3, and 1/3 commensurabilities are discussed in detail. Particular attention is given to the variation of the parameters of the libration solutions (position and stability) as functions of {$\beta$} and m1 . The analytical results are then compared with numerical simulations of the exact equations. Even though trappings are effectively found in these points, they are temporary: after a few 105-106 years the particle suffers a close encounter with the perturber, resulting in an ejection from the resonance. Concerning the orbital evolution from the nonresonant initial conditions to the final librational orbit, we find the averaged system to be adiabatic in general for m1 {$>$} 10-3{$\beta$}. In this interval, the dissipative problem can be approximated by a slowly varying one degree of freedom Hamiltonian system. We apply the formalism of the adiabatic invariant theory and discuss the mechanism and probability of capture in each resonance. Results are once again compared with numerical integrations.},

  abstract = {In recent years several pairs of extrasolar planets have been discovered in the vicinity of mean-motion commensurabilities. In some cases, such as the GJ 876 system, the planets seem to be trapped in a stationary solution, the system exhibiting a simultaneous libration of the resonant angle 1 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 22 \`A 1 \`A \$1 and of the relative position of the pericenters. In this paper we analyze the existence and location of these stable solutions, for the 2 : 1 and 3 : 1 resonances, as functions of the masses and orbital elements of both planets. This is undertaken via an analytical model for the resonant Hamiltonian function. The results are compared with those of numerical simulations of the exact equations. In the 2 : 1 commensurability, we show the existence of three principal families of stationary solutions: (1) aligned orbits, in which h1 and \$1 \`A \$2 both librate around zero, (2) antialigned orbits, in which 1 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0 and the difference in pericenter is 180, and (3) asymmetric stationary solutions, in which both the resonant angle and \$1 \`A \$2 are constants with values different from 0 or 180. Each family exists in a different domain of values of the mass ratio and eccentricities of both planets. Similar results are also found in the 3 : 1 resonance. We discuss the application of these results to the extrasolar planetary systems and develop a chart of possible planetary orbits with apsidal corotation. We estimate, also, the maximum planetary masses in order for the stationary solutions to be dynamically stable.},

The hydrodynamics algorithms are based on finite-difference upwind, dimensionally split methods. The magnetohydrodynamics algorithms consist of the constrained transport method to preserve the divergence-free property of the magnetic field to machine accuracy, coupled to a method of characteristics for the evaluation of electromotive forces and Lorentz forces. Orbital advection is implemented, and an N-body solver is included to simulate planets or stars interacting with the gas. We present our implementation in detail and present a number of widely known tests for comparison purposes. One strength of FARGO3D is that it can run on either graphical processing units (GPUs) or central processing units (CPUs), achieving large speed-up with respect to CPU cores. We describe our implementation choices, which allow a user with no prior knowledge of GPU programming to develop new routines for CPUs, and have them translated automatically for GPUs.},

In the coming years, many more disks will be mapped with ALMA at similar resolution. Interpreting the results in terms of the properties and quantities of the emitting dusty material is, however, a very non-trivial task. This is in part due to the uncertainty in the dust opacities, an uncertainty that is not likely to be resolved any time soon. It is also partly due to the fact that, as the DSHARP survey has shown, these disk often contain regions of intermediate to high optical depth, even at millimeter wavelengths and at relatively large radius in the disk. This makes the interpretation challenging, in particular if the grains are large and have a large albedo. On the other hand, the highly structured features seen in the DSHARP survey, of which strong indications were already seen in earlier observations, provide a unique opportunity to study the dust growth and dynamics. To provide continuity within the DSHARP project, its follow-up projects, and projects by other teams interested in these data, we present here the methods and opacity choices used within the DSHARP collaboration to link the measured intensity I{$\nu$} to dust surface density {$\Sigma$}d.},

Current models of the size- and radial evolution of dust in protoplanetary disks generally oversimplify either the radial evolution of the disk (by focussing at one single radius or by using steady state disk models) or they assume particle growth to proceed monodispersely or without fragmentation. Further studies of protoplanetary disks - such as observations, disk chemistry and structure calculations or planet population synthesis models - depend on the distribution of dust as a function of grain size and radial position in the disk. Aims: We attempt to improve upon current models to be able to investigate how the initial conditions, the build-up phase, and the evolution of the protoplanetary disk influence growth and transport of dust. Methods: We introduce a new model similar to Brauer et al. (2008, A\&A, 480, 859) in which we now include the time-dependent viscous evolution of the gas disk, and in which more advanced input physics and numerical integration methods are implemented. Results: We show that grain properties, the gas pressure gradient, and the amount of turbulence are much more influencing the evolution of dust than the initial conditions or the build-up phase of the protoplanetary disk. We quantify which conditions or environments are favorable for growth beyond the meter size barrier. High gas surface densities or zonal flows may help to overcome the problem of radial drift, however already a small amount of turbulence poses a much stronger obstacle for grain growth.},

Aims: We aim to derive simple equations that explain the global evolution of the dust surface density profile and the upper limit of the grain size distribution and which can readily be used for further modeling or for interpreting of observational data. Methods: We have developed a simple model that follows the upper end of the dust size distribution and the evolution of the dust surface density profile. This model is calibrated with state-of-the-art simulations of dust evolution, which treat dust growth, fragmentation, and transport in viscously evolving gas disks. Results: We find very good agreement between the full dust-evolution code and the toy model presented in this paper. We derive analytical profiles that describe the dust-to-gas ratios and the dust surface density profiles well in protoplanetary disks, as well as the radial flux by solid material "rain out", which is crucial for triggering any gravity assisted formation of planetesimals. We show that fragmentation is the dominating effect in the inner regions of the disk leading to a dust surface density exponent of -1.5, while the outer regions at later times can become drift-dominated, yielding a dust surface density exponent of -0.75. Our results show that radial drift is not efficient in fragmenting dust grains. This supports the theory that small dust grains are resupplied by fragmentation due to the turbulent state of the disk.},

Results: This work presents the first calculations predicting the mm spectral slope based on a physical model of grain growth. Our models can quite naturally reproduce the observed mm-slopes, but a simultaneous match to the observed range of flux levels can only be reached by a reduction of the dust mass by a factor of a few up to about 30 while keeping the gas mass of the disk the same. This dust reduction can either be caused by radial drift at a reduced rate or during an earlier evolutionary time (otherwise the predicted fluxes would become too low) or due to efficient conversion of dust into larger, unseen bodies.},

  abstract = {Observational evidence exists for the formation of gas giant planets on wide orbits around young stars by disk gravitational instability, but the roles of disk instability and core accretion for forming gas giants on shorter period orbits are less clear. The controversy extends to population synthesis models of exoplanet demographics and to hydrodynamical models of the fragmentation process. The latter refers largely to the handling of radiative transfer in three dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical models, which controls heating and cooling processes in gravitationally unstable disks, and hence dense clump formation. A suite of models using the \$\textbackslash beta\$ cooling approximation is presented here. The initial disks have masses of 0.091 \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$ and extend from 4 to 20 AU around a 1 \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$ protostar. The initial minimum Toomre \$Q\_i\$ values range from 1.3 to 2.7, while \$\textbackslash beta\$ ranges from 1 to 100. We show that the choice of \$Q\_i\$ is equal in importance to the \$\textbackslash beta\$ value assumed: high \$Q\_i\$ disks can be stable for small \$\textbackslash beta\$, when the initial disk temperature is taken as a lower bound, while low \$Q\_i\$ disks can fragment for high \$\textbackslash beta\$. These results imply that the evolution of disks toward low \$Q\_i\$ must be taken into account in assessing disk fragmentation possibilities, at least in the inner disk, i.e., inside about 20 AU. The models suggest that if low \$Q\_i\$ disks can form, there should be an as yet largely undetected population of gas giants orbiting G dwarfs between about 6 AU and 16 AU.},

  abstract = {Observational evidence suggests that gas disk instability may be responsible for the formation of at least some gas giant exoplanets, particularly massive or distant gas giants. With regard to close-in gas giants, Boss (2017) used the {$\beta$} cooling approximation to calculate hydrodynamical models of inner gas disk instability, finding that provided disks with low values of the initial minimum Toomre stability parameter (i.e., Qi {$<$} 2 inside 20 au) form, fragmentation into self-gravitating clumps could occur even for {$\beta$} as high as 100 (i.e., extremely slow cooling). Those results implied that the evolution of disks toward low Qi must be taken into account. This paper presents such models: initial disk masses of 0.091 M{$\odot$} extending from 4 to 20 au around a 1 M{$\odot$} protostar, with a range (1 to 100) of {$\beta$} cooling parameters, the same as in Boss (2017), but with all the disks starting with Qi = 2.7, i.e., gravitationally stable, and allowed to cool from their initial outer disk temperature of 180 K to as low as 40 K. All the disks eventually fragment into at least one dense clump. The clumps were again replaced by virtual protoplanets (VPs) and the masses and orbits of the resulting ensemble of VPs compare favorably with those of Boss (2017), supporting the claim that disk instability can form gas giants rapidly inside 20 au, provided that sufficiently massive protoplanetary disks exist.},

  abstract = {Recent laser-plasma experiments report the existence of dynamically significant magnetic fields, whose statistical characterisation is essential for understanding the physical processes these experiments are attempting to investigate. In this paper, we show how a proton imaging diagnostic can be used to determine a range of relevant magnetic field statistics, including the magnetic-energy spectrum. To achieve this goal, we explore the properties of an analytic relation between a stochastic magnetic field and the image-flux distribution created upon imaging that field. We conclude that features of the beam's final image-flux distribution often display a universal character determined by a single, field-scale dependent parameter - the contrast parameter - which quantifies the relative size of the correlation length of the stochastic field, proton displacements due to magnetic deflections, and the image magnification. For stochastic magnetic fields, we establish the existence of four contrast regimes - linear, nonlinear injective, caustic and diffusive - under which proton-flux images relate to their parent fields in a qualitatively distinct manner. As a consequence, it is demonstrated that in the linear or nonlinear injective regimes, the path-integrated magnetic field experienced by the beam can be extracted uniquely, as can the magnetic-energy spectrum under a further statistical assumption of isotropy. This is no longer the case in the caustic or diffusive regimes. We also discuss complications to the contrast-regime characterisation arising for inhomogeneous, multi-scale stochastic fields, as well as limitations currently placed by experimental capabilities on extracting magnetic field statistics. The results presented in this paper provide a comprehensive description of proton images of stochastic magnetic fields, with applications for improved analysis of given proton-flux images.},

  abstract = {Recent laser-plasma experiments report the existence of dynamically significant magnetic fields, whose statistical characterisation is essential for understanding the physical processes these experiments are attempting to investigate. In this paper, we show how a proton imaging diagnostic can be used to determine a range of relevant magnetic field statistics, including the magnetic-energy spectrum. To achieve this goal, we explore the properties of an analytic relation between a stochastic magnetic field and the image-flux distribution created upon imaging that field. We conclude that features of the beam's final image-flux distribution often display a universal character determined by a single, field-scale dependent parameter - the contrast parameter - which quantifies the relative size of the correlation length of the stochastic field, proton displacements due to magnetic deflections, and the image magnification. For stochastic magnetic fields, we establish the existence of four contrast regimes - linear, nonlinear injective, caustic and diffusive - under which proton-flux images relate to their parent fields in a qualitatively distinct manner. As a consequence, it is demonstrated that in the linear or nonlinear injective regimes, the path-integrated magnetic field experienced by the beam can be extracted uniquely, as can the magnetic-energy spectrum under a further statistical assumption of isotropy. This is no longer the case in the caustic or diffusive regimes. We also discuss complications to the contrast-regime characterisation arising for inhomogeneous, multi-scale stochastic fields, as well as limitations currently placed by experimental capabilities on extracting magnetic field statistics. The results presented in this paper provide a comprehensive description of proton images of stochastic magnetic fields, with applications for improved analysis of given proton-flux images.},

The Desert-Rim Exoplanets Atmosphere and Migration (DREAM) program aims at disentangling those processes through the study of the hot Neptune desert, whose rim hosts planets that are undergoing, or survived, atmospheric evaporation and orbital migration. In this first paper, we use the Rossiter-McLaughlin Revolutions (RMR) technique to investigate the orbital architecture of 14 close-in planets ranging from mini-Neptune to Jupiter-size and covering a broad range of orbital distances. While no signal is detected for the two smallest planets, we were able to constrain the sky-projected spin--orbit angle of six planets for the first time, to revise its value for six others, and, thanks to constraints on the stellar inclination, to derive the 3D orbital architecture in seven systems. These results reveal a striking three-quarters of polar orbits in our sample, all being systems with a single close-in planet but of various stellar and planetary types. High-eccentricity migration is favored to explain such orbits for several evaporating warm Neptunes, supporting the role of late migration in shaping the desert and populating its rim. Putting our measurements in the wider context of the close-in planet population will be useful to investigate the various processes shaping their architectures.},

In this paper, we present the results of numerical simulations with more and more realistic physics involved. Step by step, we include various effects, such as particle growth, radial/vertical particle motion and dust particle fragmentation in our simulations. We demonstrate that the initial dust-to-gas ratio is essential for the particles to overcome the radial drift barrier. If this value is increased by a factor of 2 compared with the canonical value for the interstellar medium, km-sized bodies can form in the inner disk ({$<$}2 AU) within 104 yrs. However, we find that solid particles get destroyed through collisional fragmentation. Only with the unrealistically high-threshold velocities needed for fragmentation to occur ({$>$}30 m/s), particles are able to grow to larger sizes in disks with low {$\alpha$} values. We also find that less than 5\% of the small dust grains remain in the disk after 1 Myr due to radial drift, no matter whether fragmentation is included in the simulations or not. In this paper, we also present considerable improvements to existing algorithms for dust-particle coagulation, which speed up the coagulation scheme by a factor of \textasciitilde{} 10\textasciicircum 4.},

The observations suggest that large grains are produced relatively early in disk evolution ({$<$} 1 Myr) and remain at large radii for longer periods of time (5 to 10 Myr). Simple theoretical estimates of the radial drift time of solid particles, however, imply that they would drift inward over a time scale of less than 0.1 Myr. In this paper, we address this conflict between theory and observation, using more detailed theoretical models, including the effects of sedimentation, collective drag forces and turbulent viscosity. We find that, although these effects slow down the radial drift of the dust particles, this reduction is not sufficient to explain the observationally determined long survival time of mm/cm-sized grains in protoplanetary disks. However, if for some reason the gas to dust ratio in the disk is reduced by at least a factor of 20 from the canonical value of 100 (for instance through photoevaporation of the gas), then the radial drift time scales become sufficiently large to be in agreement with observations.},

The object is currently at aphelion in what appears to be a typical orbit for a scattered Kuiper Belt object, except that it is inclined by about 44\textdegree{} from the ecliptic. The presence of such a large object at this extreme inclination suggests that high-inclination Kuiper Belt objects formed preferentially closer to the Sun.

We consistently refit published RV data sets for 65 stars and find nine systems with statistically significant trends indicating the presence of an outer companion. We combine these RV data with AO images to constrain the masses and semi-major axes of these companions. We quantify our sensitivity to the presence of long-period companions by fitting the sample with a power-law distribution and find an occurrence rate of 39\% {$\pm$} 7\% for companions 0.5\textendash 20 M Jup and 1\textendash 20 au. Half of our systems were discovered by the transit method, and half were discovered by the RV method. While differences in the RV baselines and number of data points between the two samples lead to different sensitivities to distant companions, we find that occurrence rates of gas giant companions in each sample are consistent at the 0.5{$\sigma$} level. We compare the frequency of Jupiter analogs in these systems to the equivalent rate from field star surveys and find that Jupiter analogs are more common around stars hosting super-Earths. We conclude that the presence of outer gas giants does not suppress the formation of inner super-Earths, and that these two populations of planets instead appear to be correlated. We also find that the stellar metallicities of systems with gas giant companions are higher than those without companions, in agreement with the well-established metallicity correlation from RV surveys of field stars.},

Yet on length scales smaller than \$\textbackslash sim 1\$ Mpc and mass scales smaller than \$\textbackslash sim 10\textasciicircum\{11\} M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$, the theory faces a number of challenges. For example, the observed cores of many dark-matter dominated galaxies are both less dense and less cuspy than naively predicted in \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM. The number of small galaxies and dwarf satellites in the Local Group is also far below the predicted count of low-mass dark matter halos and subhalos within similar volumes. These issues underlie the most well-documented problems with \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM: Cusp/Core, Missing Satellites, and Too-Big-to-Fail. The key question is whether a better understanding of baryon physics, dark matter physics, or both will be required to meet these challenges. Other anomalies, including the observed planar and orbital configurations of Local Group satellites and the tight baryonic/dark matter scaling relations obeyed by the galaxy population, have been less thoroughly explored in the context of \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM theory. Future surveys to discover faint, distant dwarf galaxies and to precisely measure their masses and density structure hold promising avenues for testing possible solutions to the small-scale challenges going forward. Observational programs to constrain or discover and characterize the number of truly dark low-mass halos are among the most important, and achievable, goals in this field over then next decade. These efforts will either further verify the \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM paradigm or demand a substantial revision in our understanding of the nature of dark matter.},

However, these investigations have been limited to small-scale simulations. We now present the results of a global protoplanetary disk evolution model that incorporates planetesimal formation by the streaming instability, along with viscous accretion, photoevaporation by EUV, FUV, and X-ray photons, dust evolution, the water ice line, and stratified turbulence. Our simulations produce massive (60\textendash 130 M {$\oplus$}) planetesimal belts beyond 100 au and up to {$\sim$}20 M {$\oplus$} of planetesimals in the middle regions (3\textendash 100 au). Our most comprehensive model forms 8 M {$\oplus$} of planetesimals inside 3 au, where they can give rise to terrestrial planets. The planetesimal mass formed in the inner disk depends critically on the timing of the formation of an inner cavity in the disk by high-energy photons. Our results show that the combination of photoevaporation and the streaming instability are efficient at converting the solid component of protoplanetary disks into planetesimals. Our model, however, does not form enough early planetesimals in the inner and middle regions of the disk to give rise to giant planets and super-Earths with gaseous envelopes. Additional processes such as particle pileups and mass loss driven by MHD winds may be needed to drive the formation of early planetesimal generations in the planet-forming regions of protoplanetary disks.},

We investigate the nature of the asymmetric structure in the HD\textasciitilde 135344B disk in order to understand the origin of the spirals and of the asymmetry seen in this disk. Ultimately, we aim at understanding whether or not one or more planets are needed to explain such structures. We present new ALMA sub-0.1" resolution observations in Band 3 and 4. The high spatial resolution allows us to characterize the mm-dust morphology of the disk. The low optical depth of continuum emission probes the bulk of the dust in vortex. Moreover, we combine the new observations with archival data to perform a multi-wavelength analysis and to obtain information about the dust distribution and properties inside the asymmetry. We resolve the asymmetric disk into a symmetric ring + asymmetric crescent, and observe that: (1) the spectral index strongly decreases at the center of the vortex, consistent with the presence of large grains; (2) for the first time, an azimuthal shift of the peak of the vortex with wavelength is observed; (3) the azimuthal width of the vortex decreases at longer wavelengths, as expected for dust traps. These features allow to confirm the nature of the asymmetry as a vortex. Finally a lower limit to the total mass of the vortex is \$0.3 M\_\{\textbackslash rm Jupiter\}\$. Considering the uncertainties involved in this estimate, it is possible that the actual mass of the vortex is higher and possibly within the required values (\$\textbackslash sim 4\textbackslash,\textbackslash rm M\_\{\textbackslash rm Jupiter\}\$) to launch spiral arms similar to those observed in scattered light.},

  abstract = {The presence of planets in binary systems poses interesting problems for planet formation theories, both in cases where planets must have formed in very compact discs around the individual stars and where they are located near the edge of the stable circumbinary region, where in situ formation is challenging. Dust dynamics is expected to play an important role in such systems, since dust trapping at the inner edge of circumbinary discs could aid in situ formation, but would simultaneously starve the circumstellar discs of the solid material needed to form planets. Here we investigate the dynamics of dust in binary systems using Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics. We find that all our simulations tend towards dust trapping in the circumbinary disc, but the timescale on which trapping begins depends on binary mass ratio (q) and eccentricity as well as the angular momentum of the infalling material. For q 0.1, we find that dust can initially accrete onto the circumstellar discs, but as the circumbinary cavity grows in radius, dust eventually becomes trapped in the circumbinary disc. For q = 0.01, we find that increasing the binary eccentricity increases the time required for dust trapping to begin. However, even this longer timescale is likely to be shorter than the planet formation timescale in the inner disc and is insufficient to explain the observed pre-transitional discs. This indicates that increase in companion eccentricity alone is not enough to allow significant transfer of solids from the outer to the inner disc.},

We also provide an assessment of the planet's orbital dynamics at different epochs of Saturn's growth. We find that the evolution of initially compact orbital configurations is dependent on the value of Delta a\_SJ . This implies that an evolution as that proposed in the Grand Tack model depends on the precise initial orbits of Jupiter and Saturn and on the timescales for their formation. Capture in the 1:2 MMR and inward or (nearly) stalled migration are highly favoured. Within its limits, our work suggests that the reversed migration, associated with the resonance capture of Jupiter and Saturn, may be a low probability evolutionary scenario, so that other planetary systems with giant planets are not expected to have experienced a Grand Tack-like evolutionary path.},

These maps have unveiled a rich resonant structure involving two or three planets, as well as indicating possible migration routes from secular to double resonances or pure three-planet commensurabilities. These structures are then compared to the present-day orbital architecture of observed resonant chains. In a second part of the paper, we describe N-body simulations of type-I migration. Depending on the orbital decay time-scale, we show that three-planet systems may be trapped in different combinations of independent commensurabilities: (i) double resonances, (ii) intersection between a two-planet and a first-order three-planet resonances, and (iii) simultaneous libration in two first-order three-planet resonances. These latter outcomes are found for slow migrations, while double resonances are almost always the final outcome in high-density discs. Finally, we discuss an application to the TRAPPIST-1 system. We find that, for low migration rates and planetary masses of the order of the estimated values, most three-planet sub-systems are able to reach the observed double resonances after following evolutionary routes defined by pure three-planet resonances. The final orbital configuration shows resonance offsets comparable with present-day values without the need of tidal dissipation. For the 8/5 resonance proposed to dominate the dynamics of the two inner planets, we find little evidence of its dynamical significance; instead, we propose that this relation between mean motions could be a consequence of the interaction between a pure three-planet resonance and a two-planet commensurability between planets c and d.},

In this paper, we show that transition to runaway gas accretion by cores may be self-impeded by an increase of the grain opacity in their envelope after they have acquired sufficient mass (typically 10Mearth) to enter a pebble-isolation phase. The accumulation of mm-m size pebbles in their migration barriers enhances their local fragmentation rates. The freshly produced sub-mm grains pass through the barrier, elevate the effective dust opacity and reduce the radiative flux in the cores envelope. These effects alone are adequate to suppress the transition to runaway accretion and preserve super-Earths in the stellar proximity (0.1 AU), albeit entropy advection between the envelope and the disk can further reduce the accretion rate. At intermediate distance (1AU) from their host stars, the escalation in the dust opacity dominates over entropy advection in stalling the transition to runaway accretion for marginally pebble-isolated cores. Beyond a few AU, the transformation of more massive cores to gas giants is reachable before severe depletion of disk gas. This requirement can be satisfied either in extended disks with large scale height via orderly accretion of migrating pebbles or through the mergers of oligarchic protoplanetary embryos, and can account for the correlated occurrence of long-period gas giants and close-in super-Earths.},

With N-body simulations we consider the formation of circumbinary terrestrial planets from a particle disk that is initially misaligned. We find that if terrestrial planets form in this way, in the absence of gas, they can only form close to coplanar or close to polar to the binary orbit. Planets around a circular binary form coplanar while planets around an eccentric binary can form coplanar or polar depending on the initial disk misalignment and the binary eccentricity. The more massive a terrestrial planet is, the more aligned it is (to coplanar or polar) since it has undergone more mergers that lead on average to smaller misalignment angles. Nodal precession of particle disks with very large initial inclinations lead to high mutual inclinations between the particles. This produces high relative velocities between particles that leads to mass ejections that can completely inhibit planet formation. Misaligned terrestrial circumbinary planets may be able to form in the presence of a misaligned circumbinary gas disk that may help to nodally align the particle orbits and maintain the inclination of the planets during their formation.},

  abstract = {Fiber Bundles and more general fibrations are basic objects of study in many areas of mathe- matics. A fiber bundle with base space B and fiber F can be viewed as a parameterized family of objects, each ``isomorphic'' to F , where the family is parameterized by points in B. For example a vector bundle over a space B is a parameterized family of vector spaces Vx, one for each point x {$\in$} B. Given a Lie group G, a principal G - bundle over a space B can be viewed as a parameterized family of spaces Fx, each with a free, transitive action of G (so in particular each Fx is homeomorphic to G). A covering space is also an example of a fiber bundle where the fibers are discrete sets. Sheaves and ``fibrations'' are generalizations of the notion of fiber bundles and are fundamental objects in Algebraic Geometry and Algebraic Topology, respectively.}

Our experiments show that our graph network models, which implement this inductive bias, can learn message representations equivalent to the true force vector when trained on n-body gravitational and spring-like simulations. We use symbolic regression to fit explicit algebraic equations to our trained model's message function and recover the symbolic form of Newton's law of gravitation without prior knowledge. We also show that our model generalizes better at inference time to systems with more bodies than had been experienced during training. Our approach is extensible, in principle, to any unknown interaction law learned by a graph network, and offers a valuable technique for interpreting and inferring explicit causal theories about the world from implicit knowledge captured by deep learning.},

  abstract = {Methods. We employ two distinct numerical schemes: an N-body code, adapted to include migration and eccentricity damping due to the gas disc via analytic prescriptions, and a hydrodynamics code that explicitly evolves a 2D protoplanetary disc model with embedded protoplanets. The former allows us to study the long term evolution, the latter to model the systems with greater fidelity but for shorter times. Results. After a brief period of chaotic interaction between the protoplanets that involves scattering, orbital exchange, collisions and the formation of co-orbital planets, we find that the system settles into a quiescent state of inward migration. Differential migration causes the protoplanets to form a series of mean motion resonances, such that a planet is often in resonance with both its interior and exterior neighbours. This helps prevent close encounters and leads to the protoplanetary swarm, or subgroups within it, migrating inward at a uniform rate. In about 2\% of runs a single planet is scattered onto a distant orbit with significant eccentricity, allowing it to survive in the disc for {$\sim$}106 years. Over 20\% of runs produce co-orbital planets that survive for the duration of the simulation, occupying mutual horseshoe or tadpole orbits. Conclusions. Disc-induced damping overwhelms eccentricity growth through planet-planet interactions, such that a protoplanetary swarm migrates inward. We suggest co-orbital planets may be observed in future exoplanet searches.},

The eventual fate of these systems was migration into the central star.\emph{Aims. {$<$}i/{$>$}Here we simulate the evolution of low-mass protoplanetary swarms in three dimensions. The aim is to examine both protoplanet survival rates and the dynamical structure of the resulting planetary systems, and to compare them with 2D simulations.\emph{Methods. {$<$}i/{$>$}We present results from a 3D hydrodynamic simulation of eight protoplanets embedded in a protoplanetary disc. We also present a suite of simulations performed using an \emph{N{$<$}i/{$>$}-body code, modified to include prescriptions for planetary migration and for eccentricity and inclination damping. These prescriptions were obtained by fitting analytic formulae to hydrodynamic simulations of planets embedded in discs with initially eccentric and/or inclined orbits.\emph{Results. {$<$}i/{$>$}As was found in two dimensions, differential migration produces groups of protoplanets in stable, multiple mean-motion resonances that migrate in lockstep, preventing prolonged periods of gravitational scattering. In almost all simulations, this leads to large-scale migration of the protoplanet swarm into the central star in the absence of a viable stopping mechanism. The evolution involves mutual collisions, occasional instances of large-scale scattering, and the frequent formation of the long-lived, co-orbital planet systems that arise in {$>$}30\% of all runs.\emph{Conclusions. {$<$}i/{$>$}Disc-induced damping overwhelms eccentricity and inclination growth due to planet-planet interactions, leading to large-scale migration of protoplanet swarms. Co-orbital planets are a natural outcome of dynamical relaxation in a strongly dissipative environment, and if observed in nature would imply that such a period of evolution commonly arises during planetary formation.}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Although it is well known that a massive planet opens a gap in a protoplanetary gaseous disk, there is no analytic description of the surface density profile in and near the gap. The simplest approach, which is based upon the balance between the torques due to the viscosity and the gravity of the planet and assumes local damping, leads to gaps with overestimated width, especially at low viscosity. Here, we take into account the fraction of the gravity torque that is evacuated by pressure supported waves. With a novel approach, which consists of following the fluid elements along their trajectories, we show that the flux of angular momentum carried by the waves corresponds to a pressure torque. The equilibrium profile of the disk is then set by the balance between gravity, viscous and pressure torques. We check that this balance is satisfied in numerical simulations, with a planet on a fixed circular orbit. We then use a reference numerical simulation to get an ansatz for the pressure torque, that yields gap profiles for any value of the disk viscosity, pressure scale height and planet to primary mass ratio. Those are in good agreement with profiles obtained in numerical simulations over a wide range of parameters. Finally, we provide a gap opening criterion that simultaneously involves the planet mass, the disk viscosity and the aspect ratio.},

Using N-body simulations and analytic arguments, we show that spacings derive not only from eccentricities, but also from inclinations. Flatter systems attain tighter spacings, a consequence of an eccentricity equilibrium between gravitational scatterings, which increase eccentricities, and mergers, which damp them. Dynamical friction by residual disk gas plays a critical role in regulating mergers and in damping inclinations and eccentricities. Systems with moderate gas damping and high solid surface density spawn gas-enveloped super-Earths with tight spacings, small eccentricities, and small inclinations. Systems in which super-Earths coagulate without as much ambient gas, in disks with low solid surface density, produce rocky planets with wider spacings, larger eccentricities, and larger mutual inclinations. A combination of both populations can reproduce the observed distributions of spacings, period ratios, transiting planet multiplicities, and transit duration ratios exhibited by Kepler super-Earths. The two populations, both formed in situ, also help to explain observed trends of eccentricity versus planet size, and bulk density versus method of mass measurement (radial velocities versus transit timing variations). Simplifications made in this study\textemdash including the limited time span of the simulations, and the approximate treatments of gas dynamical friction and gas depletion history\textemdash should be improved on in future work to enable a detailed quantitative comparison to the observations.},

Following Goldreich \& Schlichting (2014), we include a coupling between the dissipative semimajor axis evolution and the damping of the eccentricities. In agreement with past studies, we find that this coupling can lead to overstability of the resonance and that for a certain range of parameters capture into resonance is only temporary. Using a more general model, we show that whether overstable motion can occur depends in a characteristic way on the mass ratio between the two planets as well as their relative eccentricity damping timescales. Moreover, we show that even when escape from resonance does occur, the timescale for escape is long enough such at any given time a pair of planets is more likely to be found in a resonance rather than migrating between them. Thus, we argue that overstability of resonances cannot singlehandedly reconcile convergent migration with the observed lack of Kepler planet pairs found near resonances. However, it is possible that overstable motion in combination with other effects such as large scale orbital instability could produce the observed period ratio distribution.},

Our result differs from previous ones because of our longer simulation times, lower viscosity, and boundary conditions that allow the disk to reach a viscous steady state. We show that, for planets on circular orbits, the transition from inward to outward migration coincides with the known transition from circular to eccentric disks that occurs for planets more massive than a few Jupiters. In an eccentric disk, the torque on the outer disk weakens due to two effects: the planet launches weaker waves, and those waves travel further before damping. As a result, the torque on the inner disk dominates, and the planet pushes itself outward. Our results suggest that the many super-Jupiters observed by direct imaging at large distances from the star may have gotten there by outward migration.}

  abstract = {LIGO has detected several binary black hole (BBH) merger events that may have originated in the accretion disks of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). These events require individual black hole masses that fall within the pair instability supernova mass gap, and therefore these black holes may have been grown from hierarchical mergers. AGN disks are a prime environment for hierarchical mergers, and thus a potential location for the progenitors of BBH gravitational wave events. Understanding how a BBH embedded in an AGN disk interacts with the surrounding environment is thus crucial for determining if this interaction can lead to its merger. However, there are few high fidelity simulations of this process, and almost all are two-dimensional. We present the results from 3D, high-resolution, local shearing-box simulations of an embedded BBH interacting with an AGN disk. In these first simulations of their kind, we focus on determining the mass accretion rate and the orbital evolution rate at different BBH separations. We find that circular, equal-mass BBHs with separations greater than 10 \% of their Hill radius contract while accreting at a super-Eddington rate. At smaller separations, however, our 3D simulations find that BBHs expand their orbits. This result suggests that it may be difficult for an AGN disk to push a BBH to merger, but we discuss several mechanisms, including MHD turbulence and radiative and mechanical feedback, that could alleviate this difficulty.},

Here, we study the formation of black holes (BHs) and binary black holes (BBHs) in young star clusters, by means of 6000 N-body simulations coupled with binary population synthesis. We probe three different stellar metallicities (Z = 0.02, 0.002, and 0.0002) and two initial-density regimes (density at the half-mass radius {$\rho$}h {$\geq$} 3.4 \texttimes{} 104 and {$\geq$}1.5 \texttimes{} 102 M{$\odot$} pc-3 in dense and loose star clusters, respectively). Metal-poor clusters tend to form more massive BHs than metal-rich ones. We find {$\sim$}6, {$\sim$}2, and {$<$}1 per cent of BHs with mass mBH {$>$} 60 M{$\odot$} at Z = 0.0002, 0.002, and 0.02, respectively. In metal-poor clusters, we form intermediate-mass BHs with mass up to {$\sim$}320 M{$\odot$}. BBH mergers born via dynamical exchanges (exchanged BBHs) can be more massive than BBH mergers formed from binary evolution: the former (latter) reach total mass up to {$\sim$}140 M{$\odot$} ({$\sim$}80 M{$\odot$}). The most massive BBH merger in our simulations has primary mass {$\sim$}88 M{$\odot$}, inside the pair-instability mass gap, and a mass ratio of {$\sim$}0.5. Only BBHs born in young star clusters from metal-poor progenitors can match the masses of GW 170729, the most massive event in first and second observing run (O1 and O2), and those of GW 190412, the first unequal-mass merger. We estimate a local BBH merger rate density {$\sim$}110 and {$\sim$}55 Gpc-3 yr-1, if we assume that all stars form in loose and dense star clusters, respectively.},

  abstract = {We investigate numerically the propagation of density waves excited by a low-mass planet in a protoplanetary disk in the nonlinear regime, using two-dimensional local shearing box simulations with the grid-based code Athena at high spatial resolution (256 grid points per scale height h). The nonlinear evolution results in the wave steepening into a shock, causing damping and angular momentum transfer to the disk. On long timescales this leads to spatial redistribution of the disk density, causing migration feedback and potentially resulting in gap opening. Previous numerical studies concentrated on exploring these secondary phenomena as probes of the nonlinear wave evolution. Here we focus on exploring the evolution of the basic wave properties, such as its density profile evolution, shock formation, and post-shock wave behavior, and provide comparison with analytical theory. The generation of potential vorticity at the shock is computed analytically and is subsequently verified by simulations and used to pinpoint the shock location. We confirm the theoretical relation between the shocking length and the planet mass (including the effect of the equation of state), and the post-shock decay of the angular momentum flux carried by the wave. The post-shock evolution of the wave profile is explored, and we quantitatively confirm its convergence to the theoretically expected N-wave shape. The accuracy of various numerical algorithms used to compute the nonlinear wave evolution is also investigated: we find that higher order spatial reconstruction and high resolution are crucial for capturing the shock formation correctly.}

Low-mass planets (down to \textasciitilde 0.03 M {$\oplus$} at 1 AU) and high spatial resolution (256 grid points per scale height) are chosen to mitigate the effects of wave nonlinearity. To complement the existing numerical studies, we focus on the primary physical variables such as the spatial profile of the wave, torque density, and the angular momentum flux carried by the wave, instead of secondary quantities such as the planetary migration rate. Our results show percent level agreement with theory in both physical and Fourier spaces. New phenomena such as the change of the toque density sign far from the planet are discovered and discussed. Also, we explore the effect of the numerical algorithms and find that a high order of accuracy, high resolution, and an accurate planetary potential are crucial to achieve good agreement with the theory. We find that the use of a too large time step without properly resolving the dynamical timescale around the planet produces incorrect results and may lead to spurious gap opening. Global simulations of planet migration and gap opening violating this requirement may be affected by spurious effects resulting in, e.g., the incorrect planetary migration rate and gap opening mass.}

  abstract = {ALMA has found multiple dust gaps and rings in a number of protoplanetary disks in continuum emission at millimeter wavelengths. The origin of such structures is in debate. Recently, we documented how one super-Earth planet can open multiple (up to five) dust gaps in a disk with low viscosity (\$\textbackslash alpha\textbackslash lesssim10\textasciicircum\{-4\}\$). In this paper, we examine how the positions, depths, and total number of gaps opened by one planet depend on input parameters, and apply our results to real systems. Gap locations (equivalently, spacings) are the easiest metric to use when making comparisons between theory and observations, as positions can be robustly measured. We fit the locations of gaps empirically as functions of planet mass and disk aspect ratio. We find that the locations of the double gaps in HL Tau and TW Hya, and of all three gaps in HD 163296, are consistent with being opened by a sub-Saturn mass planet. This scenario predicts the locations of other gaps in HL Tau and TW Hya, some of which appear consistent with current observations. We also show how the Rossby wave instability may develop at the edges of several gaps and result in multiple dusty vortices, all caused by one planet. A planet as low in mass as Mars may produce multiple dust gaps in the terrestrial planet forming region.},

Armed with these data and existing H-band scattered light observations, we measure the size and depth of the disk's central cavity, and the sharpness of its outer edge, in three components: sub-{$\mu$}m-sized ``small'' dust traced by scattered light, millimeter-sized ``big'' dust traced by the millimeter continuum, and gas traced by line emission. Both dust populations feature a cavity of radius {$\sim$}70 au that is depleted by factors of at least 1000 relative to the dust density just outside. The millimeter continuum data are well explained by a cavity with a sharp edge. Scattered light observations can be fitted with a cavity in small dust that has either a sharp edge at 60 au, or an edge that transitions smoothly over an annular width of 10 au near 60 au. In gas, the data are consistent with a cavity that is smaller, about 15 au in radius, and whose surface density at 15 au is times smaller than the surface density at 70 au; the gas density grades smoothly between these two radii. The CO isotopologue observations rule out a sharp drop in gas surface density at 30 au or a double-drop model, as found by previous modeling. Future observations are needed to assess the nature of these gas and dust cavities (e.g., whether they are opened by multiple as-yet-unseen planets or photoevaporation).},

Combining two-fluid global hydrodynamics simulations with a radiative transfer code, we calculate the distributions of gas and of sub-mm-sized dust in a disk perturbed by a super-Earth, synthesizing images in near-infrared scattered light and the mm-wave thermal continuum for direct comparison with observations. In low viscosity gas (\$\textbackslash alpha\textbackslash lesssim10\textasciicircum\{-4\}\$), a super-Earth opens two annular gaps to either side of its orbit by the action of Lindblad torques. This double gap and its associated gas pressure gradients cause dust particles to be dragged by gas into three rings: one ring sandwiched between the two gaps, and two rings located at the gap edges farthest from the planet. Depending on system parameters, additional rings may manifest for a single planet. A double gap located at tens of AUs from a host star in Taurus can be detected in the dust continuum by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) at an angular resolution of \textasciitilde 0".03 after two hours of integration. Ring and gap features persist in a variety of background disk profiles, last for thousands of orbits, and change their relative positions and dimensions depending on the speed and direction of planet migration. Candidate double gaps have been observed by ALMA in systems like HL Tau (D5 and D6) and TW Hya (at 37 and 43 AU); we submit that each double gap is carved by one super-Earth in nearly inviscid gas.}

  abstract = {Dust growth is often neglected when building models of protoplanetary disks due to its complexity and computational expense. However, it does play a major role in shaping the evolution of protoplanetary dust and planet formation. In this paper, we present a numerical model coupling 2-D hydrodynamic evolution of a protoplanetary disk, including a Jupiter-mass planet, and dust coagulation. This is obtained by including multiple dust fluids in a single grid-based hydrodynamic simulation and solving the Smoluchowski equation for dust coagulation on top of solving for the hydrodynamic evolution. We find that fragmentation of dust aggregates trapped in a pressure bump outside of the planetary gap leads to an enhancement in density of small grains. We compare the results obtained from the full coagulation treatment to the commonly used, fixed dust size approach and to previously applied, less computationally intensive methods for including dust coagulation. We find that the full coagulation results cannot be reproduced using the fixed-size treatment, but some can be mimicked using a relatively simple method for estimating the characteristic dust size in every grid cell.},

Second, exposure was concentrated among users who strongly identified as Republicans. Third, exposure to the Russian influence campaign was eclipsed by content from domestic news media and politicians.

Using a generic mass-radius relationship, we find that only two pairs of planets in these candidate systems (out of 761 pairs total) appear to be on Hill-unstable orbits, indicating {$\sim$}96\% of the candidate planetary systems are correctly interpreted as true systems. We find that planet pairs show little statistical preference to be near mean-motion resonances. We identify an asymmetry in the distribution of period ratios near first-order resonances (e.g., 2:1, 3:2), with an excess of planet pairs lying wide of resonance and relatively few lying narrow of resonance. Finally, based upon the transit duration ratios of adjacent planets in each system, we find that the interior planet tends to have a smaller transit impact parameter than the exterior planet does. This finding suggests that the mode of the mutual inclinations of planetary orbital planes is in the range 1.\textdegree 0-2.\textdegree 2, for the packed systems of small planets probed by these observations.},

In contrast, the channel maps of the \emph{J{$<$}i/{$>$} = 2-1 line of the three CO isotopologs reveal gas inside the dust cavity and dust gap. The gaseous disk is also much larger than the compact dust emission; it extends to \textasciitilde 1 (\textasciitilde 180 au) in radius. This difference and the sharp drop of the continuum emission at large radii point to radial drift of large dust grains ({$>$}\emph{{$\mu<$}i/{$>$}m size). Using the thermo-chemical disk code dali, we modeled the continuum and the CO isotopolog emission to quantitatively measure the gas and dust surface densities. The resulting gas surface density is reduced by a factor of \textasciitilde 30-40 inward of the dust gap.

  abstract = {This paper presents new high angular resolution ALMA 1.3 mm dust continuum observations of the protoplanetary system AS 209 in the Ophiuchus star forming region. The dust continuum emission is characterized by a main central core and two prominent rings at \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$} = 75 au and \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$} = 130 au intervaled by two gaps at \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$} = 62 au and \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$} = 103 au. The two gaps have different widths and depths, with the inner one being narrower and shallower. We determined the surface density of the millimeter dust grains using the 3D radiative transfer disk code DALI. According to our fiducial model the inner gap is partially filled with millimeter grains while the outer gap is largely devoid of dust. The inferred surface density is compared to 3D hydrodynamical simulations (FARGO-3D) of planet-disk interaction. The outer dust gap is consistent with the presence of a giant planet (\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{planet{$<$}sub/{$>$} \textasciitilde{} 0.7 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{Saturn{$<$}sub/{$>$}); the planet is responsible for the gap opening and for the pile-up of dust at the outer edge of the planet orbit. The simulations also show that the same planet could be the origin of the inner gap at \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$} = 62 au. The relative position of the two dust gaps is close to the 2:1 resonance and we have investigated the possibility of a second planet inside the inner gap.

We report polarization measurements of five repeating FRBs, the abundant signals of which enable wide-band observations with two telescopes. A clear trend of lower polarization at lower frequencies was found, which can be well characterized by a single parameter rotation-measure-scatter ({$\sigma$}\textsubscript{RM}) and modeled by multi-path scatter. Sources with higher {$\sigma$}\textsubscript{RM} have higher RM magnitude and scattering timescales. The two sources with the most substantial {$\sigma$}\textsubscript{RM}, FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B, are associated with a compact persistent radio source. These properties indicate a complex environment near the repeating FRBs, such as a supernova remnant or a pulsar wind nebula, consistent with their arising from young populations.},

  abstract = {The final stage of the accretion of Uranus and Neptune is numerically investigated. The four Jovian planets are considered with Jupiter and Saturn assumed to have reached their present sizes, whereas Uranus and Neptune are taken with initial masses 0.2 of their present ones. Allowance is made for the orbital variation of the Jovian planets due to the exchange of angular momentum with interacting bodies ("planetesimals"). Two possible effects that may have contributed to the accretion of Uranus and Neptune are incorporated in our model: (1) an enlarged cross section for accretion of incoming planetesimals due to the presence of extended gaseous envelopes and/or circumplanetary swarms of bodies; and (2) intermediate protoplanets in mid-range orbits between the Jovian planets. Significant radial displacements are found for Uranus and Neptune during their accretion and scattering of planetesimals. The orbital angular momentum budgets of Neptune, Uranus, and Saturn turn out to be positive; i.e., they on average gain orbital angular momentum in their interactions with planetesimals and hence they are displaced outwardly. Instead, Jupiter as the main ejector of bodies loses orbital angular momentum so it moves sunward. The gravitational stirring of planetesimals caused by the introduction of intermediate protoplanets has the effect that additional solid matter is injected into the accretion zones of Uranus and Neptune. For moderate enlargements of the radius of the accretion cross section (2-4 times), the accretion time scale of Uranus and Neptune are found to be a few 10 \textsuperscript{8} years and the initial amount of solid material required to form them of a few times their present masses. Given the crucial role played by the size of the accretion cross section, questions as to when Uranus and Neptune acquired their gaseous envelopes, when the envelopes collapsed onto the solid cores, and how massive they were are essential in defining the efficiency and time scale of accretion of the two outer Jovian planets.},

Interacting binaries are also important astrophysical laboratories for the study of compact objects. Binary population synthesis studies have been used extensively over the last two decades to interpret observations of compact-object binaries and to decipher the physical processes that lead to their formation. Here, we present POSYDON, a novel, binary population synthesis code that incorporates full stellar-structure and binary-evolution modeling, using the MESA code, throughout the whole evolution of the binaries. The use of POSYDON enables the self-consistent treatment of physical processes in stellar and binary evolution, including: realistic mass-transfer calculations and assessment of stability, internal angular-momentum transport and tides, stellar core sizes, mass-transfer rates and orbital periods. This paper describes the detailed methodology and implementation of POSYDON, including the assumed physics of stellar- and binary-evolution, the extensive grids of detailed single- and binary-star models, the post-processing, classification and interpolation methods we developed for use with the grids, and the treatment of evolutionary phases that are not based on pre-calculated grids. The first version of POSYDON targets binaries with massive primary stars (potential progenitors of neutron stars or black holes) at solar metallicity.},

We found that while dust particles migrate inward, vortices are very effective at collecting them. When dust density becomes comparable to gas density within the vortex, a dynamical instability is excited and it alters the coherent vorticity pattern and destroys the vortex. This dust feedback effect is stronger with a higher initial dust/gas density ratio and larger dust grain. Consequently, we found that the disk vortex lifetime can be reduced up to a factor of 10. We discuss the implications of our findings on the survivability of vortices in protoplanetary disks and planet formation.},

Using two and three-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations to perform a systematic parameter survey, we confirm the existence of multiple spiral arms in disks with a single planet, and discover a scaling relation between the azimuthal separation of the primary and secondary arm, \$\textbackslash phi\_\{\textbackslash rm sep\}\$, and the planet-to-star mass ratio \$q\$: \$\textbackslash phi\_\{\textbackslash rm sep\} = 102\textasciicircum\{\textbackslash circ\} (q/0.001)\textasciicircum\{0.2\}\$ for companions between Neptune mass and 16 Jupiter masses around a 1 solar mass star, and \$\textbackslash phi\_\{\textbackslash rm sep\} = 180\textasciicircum\{\textbackslash circ\}\$ for brown dwarf mass companions. This relation is independent of the disk's temperature, and can be used to infer a planet's mass to within an accuracy of about 30\% given only the morphology of a face-on disk. Combining hydrodynamics and Monte-Carlo radiative transfer calculations, we verify that our numerical measurements of \$\textbackslash phi\_\{\textbackslash rm sep\}\$ are accurate representations of what would be measured in near-infrared scattered light images, such as those expected to be taken by Gemini/GPI, VLT/SPHERE, or Subaru/SCExAO in the future. Finally, we are able to infer, using our scaling relation, that the planet responsible for the spiral structure in SAO 206462 has a mass of about 6 Jupiter masses.},

  abstract = {The formation of planetesimals is an unsolved problem in planet formation theory. A prominent scenario for overcoming dust growth barriers in dead zones is the gravitational collapse of locally over-dense regions, shown to robustly produce \$\textbackslash sim\$100 km sized objects. Still, the conditions under which planetesimal formation occurs remain unclear. For collapse to proceed, the self-gravity of an overdensity must overcome stellar tidal disruption on large scales and turbulent diffusion on small scales. Here, we relate the scales of streaming and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, which both regulate particle densities on the scales of gravitational collapse, directly to planetesimal formation. We support our analytic findings by performing 3D hydrodynamical simulations of streaming and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and planetesimal formation. We find that the vertical extent of the particle mid-plane layer and the radial width of streaming instability filaments are set by the same characteristic length scale, thus governing the strength of turbulent diffusion on the scales of planetesimal formation. We present and successfully test a collapse criterion: \$0.1 Q \textbackslash beta \textbackslash epsilon\textasciicircum\{-1\}Z\textasciicircum\{-1\} \textbackslash lesssim 1\$ and show that even for Solar metallicities, planetesimals can form in dead zones of sufficiently massive disks. For a given gas Toomre-parameter \$Q\$, pressure gradient \$\textbackslash beta\$, metallicity \$Z\$ and local particle enhancement \$\textbackslash epsilon\$, the collapse criterion also provides a range of unstable scales, instituting a promising path for studying initial planetesimal mass distributions. Streaming instability is not required for planetesimal collapse, but by increasing \$\textbackslash epsilon\$, can evolve a system to instability.},

In this scenario, Palomar 5 formed with a `normal' black hole mass fraction of a few per cent, but stars were lost at a higher rate than black holes, such that the black hole fraction gradually increased. This inflated the cluster, enhancing tidal stripping and tail formation. A gigayear from now, the cluster will dissolve as a 100\% black hole cluster. Initially denser clusters end up with lower black hole fractions, smaller sizes, and no observable tails at present day. Black hole-dominated, extended star clusters are therefore the likely progenitors of the recently discovered thin stellar streams in the Galactic halo.},

  abstract = {It has been recently suggested that white dwarfs generate magnetic fields in a process analogous to the Earth. The crystallization of the core creates a compositional inversion that drives convection, and combined with rotation, this can sustain a magnetic dynamo. We reanalyse the dynamo mechanism, arising from the slow crystallization of the core, and find convective turnover times t\textsubscript{conv} of weeks to months - longer by orders of magnitude than previously thought. With white dwarf spin periods P{$\ll$}t\textsubscript{conv}, crystallization-driven dynamos are almost always in the fast rotating regime, where the magnetic field B is at least in equipartition with the convective motion and is possibly further enhanced by a factor of B{$\propto$}(t\textsubscript{conv}/P)\textsuperscript{1/2}, depending on the assumed dynamo scaling law. We track the growth of the crystallized core using MESA and compute the magnetic field B(T\textsubscript{eff}) as a function of the white dwarf's effective temperature T\textsubscript{eff}. We compare this prediction with observations and show that crystallization-driven dynamos can explain some - but not all - of the {$\sim$}MG magnetic fields measured for single white dwarfs, as well as the stronger fields measured for white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables, which were spun up by mass accretion to short P. Our B(T\textsubscript{eff}) curves might also explain the clustering of white dwarfs with Balmer emission lines around T\textsubscript{eff}{$\approx$}7500 K.},

  abstract = {Compact non-resonant systems of sub-Jovian planets are the most common outcome of the planet formation process. Despite exhibiting broad overall diversity, these planets also display dramatic signatures of intra-system uniformity in their masses, radii, and orbital spacings. Although the details of their formation and early evolution are poorly known, sub-Jovian planets are expected to emerge from their natal nebulae as multi-resonant chains, owing to planet-disk interactions. Within the context of this scenario, the architectures of observed exoplanet systems can be broadly replicated if resonances are disrupted through post-nebular dynamical instabilities. Here, we generate an ad-hoc sample of resonant chains and use a suite of N-body simulations to show that instabilities can not only reproduce the observed period ratio distribution, but that the resulting collisions also modify the mass uniformity in a way that is consistent with the data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that primordial mass uniformity, motivated by the sample of resonant chains coupled with dynamical sculpting, naturally generates uniformity in orbital period spacing similar to what is observed. Finally, we find that almost all collisions lead to perfect mergers, but some form of post-instability damping is likely needed to fully account for the present-day dynamically cold architectures of sub-Jovian exoplanets.},

The results show that: (1) the external potential exerts torques on the disk only at the Lindblad and corotation resonances; (2) the torque is positive at the outer Lindblad resonance and negative at the inner Lindblad resonance; (3) the torque at corotation has the sign of the radial vorticity gradient; and (4) the torques are of the same order of magnitude at both types of resonance and independent of the speed of sound in the disk. It is found that the external potential also excites density waves in the vicinity of the Lindblad and corotation resonances, that the long trailing wave is excited at a Lindblad resonance, and that short trailing waves are excited at the corotation resonance. The behavior of particle disks is briefly discussed, and the external torques on particle disks are proven to be identical to those on gas disks},

  abstract = {We assess the multi-planet systems discovered by the Kepler satellite in terms of current ideas about orbital migration and eccentricity damping due to planet-disk interactions. Our primary focus is on first order mean motion resonances, which we investigate analytically to lowest order in eccentricity. Only a few percent of planet pairs are in close proximity to a resonance. However, predicted migration rates (parameterized by \textbackslash tau \_n=n/\{|\textbackslash dot\{n\}|\}) imply that during convergent migration most planets would have been captured into first order resonances. Eccentricity damping (parameterized by \textbackslash tau \_e=e/\{|\textbackslash dot\{e\}|\}) offers a plausible resolution. Estimates suggest {$\tau$} e /{$\tau$} n \textasciitilde{} (h/a)2 \textasciitilde{} 10-2, where h/a is the ratio of disk thickness to radius. Together, eccentricity damping and orbital migration give rise to an equilibrium eccentricity, e eq \textasciitilde{} ({$\tau$} e /{$\tau$} n )1/2. Capture is permanent provided e eq {$<\sptilde$} {$\mu$}1/3, where {$\mu$} denotes the planet to star mass ratio. But for e eq {$>\sptilde$} {$\mu$}1/3, capture is only temporary because librations around equilibrium are overstable and lead to passage through resonance on timescale {$\tau$} e . Most Kepler planet pairs have e eq {$>$} {$\mu$}1/3. Since {$\tau$} n Gt {$\tau$} e is the timescale for migration between neighboring resonances, only a modest percentage of pairs end up trapped in resonances after the disk disappears. Thus the paucity of resonances among Kepler pairs should not be taken as evidence for in situ planet formation or the disruptive effects of disk turbulence. Planet pairs close to a mean motion resonance typically exhibit period ratios 1\%-2\% larger than those for exact resonance. The direction of this shift undoubtedly reflects the same asymmetry that requires convergent migration for resonance capture. Permanent resonance capture at these separations from exact resonance would demand {$\mu$}({$\tau$} n /{$\tau$} e )1/2 {$>\sptilde$} 0.01, a value that estimates of {$\mu$} from transit data and ({$\tau$} e /{$\tau$} n )1/2 from theory are insufficient to match. Plausible alternatives involve eccentricity damping during or after disk dispersal. The overstability referred to above has applications beyond those considered in this investigation. It was discovered numerically by Meyer \& Wisdom in their study of the tidal evolution of Saturn's satellites.},

In the case that {$\nu$}18 acted before the 2:3 resonance encounter, the plutino would have been originally formed near 34 AU. If the plutino was captured near the beginning of the migration process at around 30.5 AU, then the secular resonance must have acted inside the 2:3 resonance with high-amplitude libration. In this case, the libration amplitude must be damped either during the migration by some dynamical process or after migration through dynamical scattering by other Kuiper belt objects, thus making the final orbit stable. All plutinos with well-determined orbits and inclination above 10\textdegree{} seem to have undergone secular resonance.},

The effects of many small planets can be represented as a viscosity if the wakes damp locally, but the viscosity is proportional to the damping length. Damping occurs mainly by shocks even for earth-mass planets. The excitation of the wake follows from standard linear theory including the torque cutoff. We use this as input to an approximate but quantitative nonlinear theory based on Burger's equation for the subsequent propagation and shock. Shock damping is indeed local but weakly so. If all metals in a minimum-mass solar nebula are invested in planets of a few earth masses each, dimensionless viscosities [alpha] of order dex(-4) to dex(-3) result. We compare this with observational constraints. Such small planets would have escaped detection in radial-velocity surveys and could be ubiquitous. If so, then the similarity of the observed lifetime of T Tauri disks to the theoretical timescale for assembling a rocky planet may be fate rather than coincidence.}

  abstract = {Observations of exoplanets have revealed that systems with planets on closely-spaced orbits are common, which motivates the question "How closely can planets orbit to one another and still be dynamically-stable for very long times?". To address this question, we investigate the stability of idealized planetary systems consisting of five planets, each equal in mass to the Earth, orbiting a one solar mass star. All planets orbit in the same plane and in the same direction, and the planets are uniformly spaced in units of mutual Hill Sphere radii. Most of the systems that we integrate begin with one or more planets on eccentric orbits, with eccentricities \$e\$ as large as \$e= 0.05\$ being considered. For a given initial orbital separation, larger initial eccentricity of a single planet generally leads to shorter system lifetime, with little systematic dependence of which planet is initially on an eccentric orbit. The approximate trend of instability times increasing exponentially with initial orbital separation of the planets found previously for planets with initially circular orbits is also present for systems with initially eccentric orbits. Mean motion resonances also tend to destabilize these systems, although the reductions in system lifetimes are not as large as for initially circular orbits. Systems with all planets having initial \$e= 0.05\$ and aligned periapse angles typically survive far longer than systems with the same spacing in initial semi-major axis and one planet with \$e= 0.05\$, but they have slightly shorter lifetimes than those with planets initially on circular orbits.},

By carefully choosing the modes having the same l and m which satisfy the mode-coupling selection rules, a period spacing pattern of quadrupole gravity modes ({$\Delta$}P {$\approx$}2520 sec) can be discerned in the Fourier spectrum and its echelle diagram. The inferred period spacing value agrees remarkably well with the theoretical l=2,m=0 g modes from a star with measured mass, radius and effective temperature. We also find that the two largest-amplitude TEOs at N=90, 91 harmonics are very close to resonance with l=2,m=0 eigenmodes, and likely come from different stars. They can essentially be regarded as eigenfrequencies to infer the stellar parameters.},

AS 209 hosts one of the most unusual disks from the Disk Substructures at High Angular Resolution Project sample, the first high angular resolution Atacama Large Millimeter Array survey of disks, as nearly all of the emission can be explained with concentric Gaussian rings. In particular, the dust emission consists of a series of narrow and closely spaced rings in the inner {$\sim$}60 au, two well-separated bright rings in the outer disk, centered at 74 and 120 au, and at least two fainter emission features at 90 and 130 au. We model the visibilities with a parametric representation of the radial surface brightness profile, consisting of a central core and seven concentric Gaussian rings. Recent hydrodynamical simulations of low-viscosity disks show that super-Earth planets can produce the multiple gaps seen in AS 209 millimeter continuum emission. The 12CO line emission is centrally peaked and extends out to {$\sim$}300 au, much farther than the millimeter dust emission. We find axisymmetric, localized deficits of CO emission around four distinct radii, near 45, 75, 120, and 210 au. The outermost gap is located well beyond the edge of the millimeter dust emission, and therefore cannot be due to dust opacity and must be caused by a genuine CO surface density reduction, due either to chemical effects or depletion of the overall gas content.},

The new model generalizes integrable Hamiltonians previously derived for first-order resonances to the case of higher-order resonances by exploiting a surprising near-symmetry of the full, non-integrable Hamiltonians of higher-order resonances. Whereas past works have frequently relied on truncated disturbing function expansions to derive integrable approximations to resonant motion, I show that no such expansion is necessary to derive an integrable model. This enables the new model to accurately capture the dynamics of both first- and higher-order resonances for eccentricities up to orbit-crossing. I demonstrate that predictions of the new integrable model agree well with numerical integrations of resonant planet pairs. Finally, I explore the secular evolution of resonant planets' eccentricities. I show that the secular dynamics are governed by conservation of an AMD-like quantity. I also demonstrate that secular frequencies depend on planets' resonant libration amplitude and this generally gives rise to a secular resonance inside the mean motion resonance at large libration amplitudes. The integrable model derived in this work can serve as a framework for analyzing the dynamics of planetary MMRs in a wide variety of contexts.},

Convergent orbital migration and resonant capture at the time of formation would naturally explain the present-day resonant orbital configurations of these systems. Planets that experience smooth migration and eccentricity damping forces due to a proto-planetary disk should not only capture into mean motion resonances but also end up in a specific dynamical configuration within the resonance, sometimes referred to as apsidal corotation resonance (ACR). Here we develop a method for testing the hypothesis that a planet pair resides in an ACR by directly fitting radial velocity data. The ACR hypothesis strongly restricts the number of free parameters describing the radial velocity signal and we compare fits using this highly restricted model to fits using a more conventional two-planet RV model by using nested sampling simulations. We apply our method to HD 45364 and HD 33844, two systems hosting giant planet pairs in 3:2 and 5:3 resonances, respectively. We demonstrate that the observations of both systems support an ACR configuration and we use the results of our ACR model fits to constrain possible migration histories of these systems.},

This instability may evolve into dust-trapping vortices that might explain the "banana-shaped" features in recently observed asymmetric transition discs with inner cavities. Previous hydrodynamical simulations of planet-induced vortices have neglected the timescale of hundreds to thousands of orbits to grow a massive planet to Jupiter-size. In this work, we study the effect of a giant planet's runaway growth timescale on the lifetime and characteristics of the resulting vortex. For two different planet masses (1 and 5 Jupiter masses) and two different disc viscosities (\$\textbackslash alpha\$=3\$\textbackslash times 10\textasciicircum\{-4\}\$ and 3\$\textbackslash times10\textasciicircum\{-5\}\$), we compare the vortices induced by planets with several different growth timescales between 10 and 4000 planet orbits. In general, we find that slowly-growing planets create significantly weaker vortices with lifetimes and surface densities reduced by more than \$50\textbackslash\%\$. For the higher disc viscosity, the longest growth timescales in our study inhibit vortex formation altogether. Additionally, slowly-growing planets produce vortices that are up to twice as elongated, with azimuthal extents well above \$180\textasciicircum\{\textbackslash circ\}\$ in some cases. These unique, elongated vortices likely create a distinct signature in the dust observations that differentiates them from the more concentrated vortices that correspond to planets with faster growth timescales. Lastly, we find that the low viscosities necessary for vortex formation likely prevent planets from growing quickly enough to trigger the instability in self-consistent models.}

The output of the Monte Carlo model is then subjected to the selection effects that mimic the observations of a transiting planet search such as that performed by the Kepler satellite. The resulting comparison of the output to the properties of the observed sample yields an encouraging agreement in terms of the relative frequencies of multiple-planet systems and the distribution of the mutual inclinations when moderate tidal circularization is taken into account. The broad features of the period distribution and radius distribution can also be matched within this framework, although the model underpredicts the distribution of small period ratios. This likely indicates that some dissipation is still required in the formation process. The most striking deviation between the model and observations is in the ratio of single to multiple systems in that there are roughly 50\% more single-planet candidates observed than are produced in any model population. This suggests that some systems must suffer additional attrition to reduce the number of planets or increase the range of inclinations.},

We use a population synthesis approach, in which we seed the disc with satellite embryos and let them migrate, accrete mass, collide, with subsequent generations being created until the disc is dissipated. In each run we choose randomly the dust-to-gas ratio, dispersion- and refilling time-scales, the number of embryos and their starting locations in a plausible range. The disc structure is the result of a 3D global disc SPH simulation \textbackslash citep\{Szulagyi16b\}. We also investigate the effect of the planet's semi-major axis on the resulting satellite systems, taking 50 AU as the nominal case. In the nominal case we find that most satellites are close in mass to the Galilean ones, with a maximum at around 3 \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm\{Earth\}\}\$ and form typically on time-scales comparable to the dispersion time-scale. We also find that about 10 \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm\{Earth\}\}\$ worth of satellites migrate into the planet, polluting it with metals. The influence of a different planet semi-major axis is mainly felt through the change in disc size. We find that for the discs closer to the star, the satellites are lighter, formation time-scales are longer, and more moons are lost into the planet, as a smaller disc means easier migration for the massive satellites. The probability of detecting satellites like the ones in this work is very low (\$\textbackslash leq\$ 3\%) even with upcoming powerful telescopes like E-ELT.},

The continuum observations resolve and allow us to characterize the previously discovered dust rings at radii of 67 and 100 au. They also reveal new small scale structures, such as a dark gap at 10 au, a bright ring at 15 au, a dust crescent at a radius of 55 au, and several fainter azimuthal asymmetries. The observations of the CO and dust emission inform about the vertical structure of the disk and allow us to directly constrain the dust extinction optical depth at the dust rings. Furthermore, the observed asymmetries in the dust continuum emission corroborate to the hypothesis that the complex structure of the HD 163296 disk is the result of the gravitational interaction with yet unseen planets.},

High resolution observations for 3 additional sources were obtained from literature. In all cases the disk emission is spatially resolved. We adopt a self consistent accretion disk model based on the similarity solution for the disk surface density and constrain the dust radial density distribution on spatial scales of about 40 AU. Disk surface densities appear to be correlated with the stellar ages where the characteristic disk radius increases from \textasciitilde{} 20 AU to 100 AU over about 5 Myr. This disk expansion is accompanied by a decrease in the mass accretion rate, suggesting that our sample disks form an evolutionary sequence. Interpreting our results in terms of the temporal evolution of a viscous \$\textbackslash alpha\$-disk, we estimate (i) that at the beginning of the disk evolution about 60\% of the circumstellar material was located inside radii of 25\textendash 40 AU, (ii) that disks formed with masses from 0.05 to 0.4 M\$\_\{\textbackslash sun\}\$ and (iii) that the viscous timescale at the disk initial radius is about 0.1-0.3 Myr. Viscous disk models tightly link the surface density \$\textbackslash Sigma(R)\$ with the radial profile of the disk viscosity \$\textbackslash nu(R) \textbackslash propto R\textasciicircum\{\textbackslash gamma\}\$. We find values of \$\textbackslash gamma\$ ranging from -0.8 to 0.8, suggesting that the viscosity dependence on the orbital radius can be very different in the observed disks. Adopting the \$\textbackslash alpha\$ parameterization for the viscosity, we argue that \$\textbackslash alpha\$ must decrease with the orbital radius and that it may vary between 0.5 and \$10\textasciicircum\{-4\}\$.

Their orbital configuration - measured as the period ratio distribution of adjacent planets in multiplanet systems - is a strong constraint for formation models. Here, we use N-body simulations with synthetic forces from an underlying evolving gaseous disc to model the formation and long-term dynamical evolution of super-Earth systems. While the gas disc is present, planetary embryos grow and migrate inward to form a resonant chain anchored at the inner edge of the disc. These resonant chains are far more compact than the observed super-Earth systems. Once the gas dissipates, resonant chains may become dynamically unstable. They undergo a phase of giant impacts that spreads the systems out. Disc turbulence has no measurable effect on the outcome. Our simulations match observations if a small fraction of resonant chains remain stable, while most super-Earths undergo a late dynamical instability. Our statistical analysis restricts the contribution of stable systems to less than 25 per cent. Our results also suggest that the large fraction of observed single-planet systems does not necessarily imply any dichotomy in the architecture of planetary systems. Finally, we use the low abundance of resonances in Kepler data to argue that, in reality, the survival of resonant chains happens likely only in {$\sim$}5 per cent of the cases. This leads to a mystery: in our simulations only 50-60 per cent of resonant chains became unstable, whereas at least 75 per cent (and probably 90-95 per cent) must be unstable to match observations.},

The rapidity, directional accuracy, and sensitivity of follow-up observations with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) are considered. We show that with current methodology, the rapidity criteria fails for triggered MWA observations above 136 MHz for BNS mergers within the aLIGO/Virgo horizon, for which little dispersive delay is expected. A calculation of the expected reduction in response time by triggering on `negative latency' alerts from aLIGO/Virgo observations of gravitational waves generated by the BNS inspiral is presented. This allows for observations up to 300 MHz where the radio signal is expected to be stronger. To compensate for the poor positional accuracy expected from these alerts, we propose a new MWA observational mode that is capable of viewing one quarter of the sky. We show the sensitivity of this mode is sufficient to detect an FRB-like burst from an event similar to GW170817 if it occurred during the ongoing aLIGO/Virgo third science run (O3).},

In the last stage of their orbital evolution, gravitational wave radiation drives the binary inspiral and produces the loudest siren awaiting to be detected by gravitational wave observatories. Periodically varying emission from active galactic nuclei has been proposed as a powerful approach to probe such systems, although none of the identified candidates are close to their final coalescence such that the observed periods stay constant in time. In this work, we report on the first system with rapid decaying periods revealed by its optical and X-ray light curves, which has decreased from about one year to one month in three years. Together with its optical hydrogen line spectroscopy, we propose that the system is an uneven mass-ratio, highly eccentric SMBH binary which will merge within three years, as predicted by the trajectory evolution model. If the interpretation is true, coordinated, multi-band electromagnetic campaign should be planned for this first binary SMBH merger event observed in human history, together with possible neutrino measurements. Gravitational wave memory from this event may also be detectable by Pulsar Timing Array with additional five-to-ten year observation.},

  abstract = {The formation of cold gas giants akin to Jupiter and Saturn in orbit and mass is a major challenge for planetesimal-driven core accretion models, due to the low core growth rates far from the star. Here we model the growth and migration of single protoplanets that accrete planetesimals and gas. We integrate the core growth rate using the fits of Tanaka \& Ida (1999) to N-body simulations, which provide the efficiency of accreting the planetesimals that a protoplanet migrates through. We take into account three constraints from the Solar System and from protoplanetary discs: (1) the masses of the terrestrial planets and the comet reservoirs in Neptune's scattered disc and the Oort cloud are consistent with a primordial planetesimal population of a few Earth masses per astronomical unit, (2) evidence from the asteroid belt and the Kuiper belt points to a characteristic planetesimal diameter of 100 km, and (3) observations of protoplanetary discs indicate that the dust is stirred by weak turbulence; such gas turbulence also excites the inclinations of planetesimals. Our nominal model built on these constraints results in maximum protoplanet masses of \$0.1\$ Earth masses. Ignoring constraint (1) above, we show that even a planetesimal population of 1,000 Earth masses, corresponding to 50 Earth masses per astronomical unit, fails to produce cold gas giants (although it successfully forms hot and warm gas giants). We conclude that a massive planetesimal reservoir is in itself insufficient to produce cold gas giants. The formation of cold gas giants by planetesimal accretion requires additionally that planetesimals are small and that the turbulent stirring is very weak, thereby violating all three above constraints.},

Observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope reveal a rich emission-line mid-infrared spectrum from water vapour, which indicates an origin in an extremely dense disk surface, heated by a shock from the infalling envelope material. Once a protoplanetary disk has formed, planetesimals are thought to develop as the products of collisions between dust grains form ever larger objects. But current theories fail at the point where metre-sized boulders are formed: theory has them falling into the central protostar too quickly to form kilometre-sized planetesimals. New computer simulations suggest that the interaction of the gas disk with the boulders creates extremely dense regions. There the boulders are so close to each other that their mutual gravity draws them together into solid objects of many kilometres in size, forming directly the planetesimals that serve as building blocks of planets.},

  abstract = {Stellar-mass black holes can become embedded within the gaseous disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Afterwards, their interactions are mediated by their gaseous surroundings. In this work, we study the evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) embedded within AGN disks using a combination of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations and analytic methods, focusing on environments in which the AGN disk scale height H is  the BBH sphere of influence. We model the local surroundings of the embedded BBHs using a wind tunnel formalism and characterize different accretion regimes based on the local properties of the disk, which range from wind-dominated to quasi-spherical. We use our simulations to develop prescriptions for mass accretion and drag for embedded BBHs. We use these prescriptions, along with AGN disk models that can represent the Toomre-unstable outer regions of AGN disks, to study the long-term evolution of the BBHs as they migrate through the disk. We find that BBHs typically merge within 5-30\,Myr, increasing their mass significantly in the process, allowing BBHs to enter (or cross) the pair-instability supernova mass gap. The rate at which gas is supplied to these BBHs often exceeds the Eddington limit, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. We conclude that most embedded BBHs will merge before migrating significantly in the disk. Depending on the conditions of the ambient gas and the distance to the system, LISA can detect the transition between the gas-dominated and gravitational wave dominated regime for inspiraling BBHs that are formed sufficiently close to the AGN ( 0.1 pc). We also discuss possible electromagnetic signatures during and following the inspiral, finding that it is generally unlikely but not inconceivable for the bolometric luminosity of the BBH to exceed that of the host AGN.},

  abstract = {When two planets are born in a protoplanetary disk, they may enter into a mean-motion resonance as a consequence of the convergent planetary migration. The formation of mean-motion resonances is important for understanding how the planetary systems are shaped in the disk environments. Motivated by recent progress in the comprehension of the migration of partial gap-opening planets, we have investigated the orbital evolution of the planet pairs in a wide range of masses and disk properties with the aim to find out when the resonance capture is likely to happen. Using the formula for the migration timescale of a gap-opening planet developed in our previous work, we have derived a simple criterion that allows us to predict when the migration will be convergent (divergent). Further, we have verified the criterion using two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. We have found that the resonant pair of planets formed at the early phase of evolution can depart from the resonance at later times because the migration speed of the outer planet slows down due to the gap formation. Moreover, adopting our formula of the migration timescale, we have also carried out three-body simulations, which confirm the results of hydrodynamic simulations. Finally, we have compared our predictions with the observations, selecting a sample of known two-planet systems.},

First we simulate the dynamics of the planetary systems in their present day configurations and determine the fraction of stable planetary orbits within their habitable zones. Then, we postulate that the eccentricity of the giant planet is a result of an instability in their past during which one or more other planets were ejected from the system. We simulate these scenarios and investigate whether planets orbiting in the habitable zone survive the instability. Explicitly we determine the fraction of test particles, originally found in the habitable zone, which remain in the habitable zone today. We label this fraction the resilient habitability of a system. We find that for most systems the probability of planets existing [or surviving] on stable orbits in the habitable zone becomes significantly smaller when we include a phase of instability in their history. We present a list of candidate systems with high resilient habitability for future observations. These are: HD 95872, HD 154345, HD 102843, HD 25015, GJ 328, HD 6718 and HD 150706. The known planets in the last two systems have large observational uncertainties on their eccentricities, which propagate into large uncertainties on their resilient habitability.

The model is computationally efficient and allows for a global, comprehensive approach to the evolution of solid particles due to gas-solid coupling, coagulation, sedimentation, and evaporation/condensation. The co-evolution of gas and solids is calculated for 10\textsuperscript{7{$<$}sup/{$>$} yr for several evolution regimes and starting from a comprehensive domain of initial conditions. The output of a single evolutionary run is a spatial distribution of mass locked in a planetesimal swarm. Because swarm's mass distribution is related to the architecture of a nascent planetary system, diversity of swarms is taken as a proxy for a diversity of planetary systems. We have found that disks with low values of specific angular momentum are bled out of solids and do not form planetary systems. Disks with high and intermediate values of specific angular momentum form diverse planetary systems.

There is an apparent excess of single-transit planet systems that cannot be explained by transit geometries alone, when a single planetary mutual inclination dispersion is assumed. This suggests that the observed compact planetary systems have at least two different architectures. We present a scenario where the ``Kepler dichotomy'' may be explained by the action of an external giant planet or stellar companion misaligned with the inner multi-planet system. The external companion excites mutual inclinations of the inner planets, causing such systems to appear as ``Kepler singles'' in transit surveys. We derive approximate analytic expressions (in various limiting regimes), calibrated with numerical calculations, for the mutual inclination excitations for various planetary systems and perturber properties (mass mp, semimajor axis ap, and inclination ). In general, the excited mutual inclination increases with and , though secular resonances may lead to large mutual inclinations even for small . We discuss the implications of our results for understanding the dynamical history of transiting planet systems with known external perturbers.},

Coagulation of dust grains leads to dust size growth that, under typical disk conditions, produces faster radial drifts, potentially threatening the dust ring formation. Utilizing 2D hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary disks that include a full treatment of dust coagulation, we find that if the planet does not open a gap quickly enough, the formation of an inner ring is impeded due to dust coagulation and subsequent radial drift. Furthermore, we find that a "buildup" of submillimeter-sized grains often appears in the dust emission at the outer edge of the dust disk.},

Recent observations indicate that planets in MMR can be either apsidally aligned or anti-aligned. How these different configurations arise is unclear. In this paper, we study the MMR capture process of migrating planets, focusing on the property of the apsidal angles of the captured planets. We show that the standard picture of MMR capture, in which the planets undergo convergent migration and experience eccentricity damping due to planet-disc interactions, always leads to apsidal anti-alignment of the captured planets. However, when the planets experience eccentricity driving from the disc, apsidally aligned configuration in MMR can be produced. In this configuration, both planets' resonance angles circulate, but a "mixed" resonance angle librates and traps the planets near the nominal resonance location. The MMR capture process in the presence of disc eccentricity driving is generally complex and irregular, and can lead to various outcomes, including apsidal alignment and anti-alignment, as well as the disruption of the resonance. We suggest that the two resonant planets in the K2-19 system, with their moderate eccentricities and aligned apsides, have experienced eccentricity driving from their natal disc in the past.},

  abstract = {The discovery by Marcy and coworkers of two planets in 2:1 orbital resonance about the star GJ 876 has been supplemented by a dynamical fit to the data by Laughlin \& Chambers, which places the planets in coplanar orbits deep in three resonances at the 2:1 mean-motion commensurability. The selection of this almost singular state by the dynamical fit means that the resonances are almost certainly real, and with the small amplitudes of libration of the resonance variables, indefinitely stable. Several unusual properties of the 2:1 resonances are revealed by the GJ 876 system. The libration of both lowest order mean-motion resonance variables and the secular resonance variable, \texttheta 1={$\lambda$}1- 2{$\lambda$}2+{$\varpi$}1, \texttheta 2={$\lambda$}1- 2{$\lambda$}2+{$\varpi$}2, and \texttheta 3={$\varpi$}1-{$\varpi$}2, about 0\textdegree{} (where {$\lambda$}1,2 are the mean longitudes of the inner and outer planet and {$\varpi$}1,2 are the longitudes of periapse) differs from the familiar geometry of the Io-Europa pair, where \texttheta 2 and \texttheta 3 librate about 180\textdegree. By considering the condition that {$\varpi$}1={$\varpi$}2 for stable simultaneous librations of \texttheta 1 and \texttheta 2, we show that the GJ 876 geometry results from the large orbital eccentricities ei, whereas the very small eccentricities in the Io-Europa system lead to the latter's geometry. Surprisingly, the GJ 876 configuration, with \texttheta 1, \texttheta 2, and \texttheta 3 all librating, remains stable for e1 up to 0.86 and for amplitude of libration of \texttheta 1 approaching 45\textdegree{} with the current eccentricities-further supporting the indefinite stability of the existing system. Any process that drives originally widely separated orbits toward each other could result in capture into the observed resonances at the 2:1 commensurability. We find that forced inward migration of the outer planet of the GJ 876 system results in certain capture into the observed resonances if initially e1{$<\sptilde$}0.06 and e2{$<\sptilde$}0.03 and the migration rate |a2/a2|{$<\sptilde$}3\texttimes 10- 2(a2/AU)-3/2yr-1. Larger eccentricities lead to likely capture into higher order resonances before the 2:1 commensurability is reached. The planets are sufficiently massive to open gaps in the nebular disk surrounding the young GJ 876 and to clear the disk material between them, and the resulting planet-nebular interaction typically forces the outer planet to migrate inward on the disk viscous timescale, whose inverse is about 3 orders of magnitude less than the above upper bound on |a2/a2| for certain capture. If there is no eccentricity damping, eccentricity growth is rapid with continued migration within the resonance, with ei exceeding the observed values after a further reduction in the semimajor axes ai of only 7\%. With eccentricity damping ei/ei=-K|ai/ai|, the eccentricities reach equilibrium values that remain constant for arbitrarily long migration within the resonances. The equilibrium eccentricities are close to the observed eccentricities for K\textasciitilde 100 if there is migration and damping of the outer planet only, but for K\textasciitilde 10 if there is also migration and damping of the inner planet. This result is independent of the magnitude or functional form of the migration rate ai as long as ei/ei=-K|ai/ai|. Although existing analytic estimates of the effects of planet-nebula interaction are consistent with this form of eccentricity damping for certain disk parameter values, it is as yet unclear that such interaction can produce the large value of K required to obtain the observed eccentricities. The alternative eccentricity damping by tidal dissipation within the star or the planets is completely negligible, so the observed dynamical properties of the GJ 876 system may require an unlikely fine-tuning of the time of resonance capture to be near the end of the nebula lifetime.},

We present a quantitative study on the variability of the cloud albedo at 365 nm and its impact on Venus' solar heating rates based on an analysis of Venus Express and Akatsuki's UV images, and Hubble Space Telescope and MESSENGER's UV spectral data; in this analysis the calibration correction factor of the UV images of Venus Express (VMC) is updated relative to the Hubble and MESSENGER albedo measurements. Our results indicate that the 365-nm albedo varied by a factor of 2 from 2006 to 2017 over the entire planet, producing a 25-40\% change in the low latitude solar heating rate according to our radiative transfer calculations. Thus, the cloud top level atmosphere should have experienced considerable solar heating variations over this period. Our global circulation model calculations show that this variable solar heating rate may explain the observed variations of zonal wind from 2006 to 2017. Overlaps in the timescale of the long-term UV albedo and the solar activity variations make it plausible that solar extreme UV intensity and cosmic-ray variations influenced the observed albedo trends. The albedo variations might also be linked with temporal variations of the upper cloud SO2 gas abundance, which affects the H2SO4-H2O aerosol formation.},

Our model quantifies the dominant gravitational physics, combining both strong and weak single-binary interactions, that drives the time evolution of binary orbital parameter distributions in dense stellar environments. We focus in particular the distributions of binary orbital energies and eccentricities. We find a novel steady state distribution of binary eccentricities, featuring strong depletions of both the highest and the lowest eccentricity binaries. In energy space, we compare the predictions of our analytic model to the results of numerical N-body simulations, and find that the agreement is good for the initial conditions considered here.

  abstract = {We present an approach for using machine learning to automatically discover the governing equations and hidden properties of real physical systems from observations. We train a "graph neural network" to simulate the dynamics of our solar system's Sun, planets, and large moons from 30 years of trajectory data. We then use symbolic regression to discover an analytical expression for the force law implicitly learned by the neural network, which our results showed is equivalent to Newton's law of gravitation. The key assumptions that were required were translational and rotational equivariance, and Newton's second and third laws of motion. Our approach correctly discovered the form of the symbolic force law. Furthermore, our approach did not require any assumptions about the masses of planets and moons or physical constants. They, too, were accurately inferred through our methods. Though, of course, the classical law of gravitation has been known since Isaac Newton, our result serves as a validation that our method can discover unknown laws and hidden properties from observed data. More broadly this work represents a key step toward realizing the potential of machine learning for accelerating scientific discovery.},

By carrying out high-resolution 2D gas and dust two-fluid hydrodynamical simulations, we find that the planet's orbit can be circularized at large radii. After the planet's orbit is circularized, partial gap opening and dust ring formation happen close to the planet's circularization radius, which can explain the observed gaps/rings at the outer region of disks. When the disk mass and viscosity become low, we find that an eccentric planet can even open gaps and produce dust rings close to the pericenter and apocenter radii before its circularization. This offers alternative scenarios for explaining the observed dust rings and gaps in protoplanetary disks. A lower disk viscosity is favored to produce brighter rings in observations. An eccentric planet can also potentially slow down the dust radial drift in the outer region of the disk when the disk viscosity is low (\$\textbackslash alpha \textbackslash lesssim2\textbackslash times10\textasciicircum\{-4\}\$) and the circularization is faster than the dust radial drift.},

  abstract = {The growth of solids from submicron to millimeter and centimeter sizes is the early step toward the formation of planets inside protoplanetary disks (PPDs). However, such processes and their potential impact on the later stages of solid growth are still poorly understood. In this work, we test the hypothesis that most disks contain at least one ringed structure with a relatively small radius. We have carried out a large family of 1D two-fluid (gas+dust) hydrodynamical simulations by evolving the gas and dust motion self-consistently while allowing dust size to evolve via coagulation and fragmentation. We investigate the joint effects of ringed structures and dust size growth on the overall submillimeter and millimeter flux and spectral index of PPDs. Ringed structures slow down the dust radial drift and speed up the dust growth. In particular, we find that those unresolved disks with a high fragmentation velocity ({$\sim$}10 m s\textsuperscript{-1}) and a high dust surface density ({$\sim$}10 g cm\textsuperscript{-2} in the ring) can have millimeter spectral indices as low as {$\sim$}2.0, consistent with millimeter observations of faint disks in nearby star-forming regions. Furthermore, disks with more than one ringed structure can potentially reproduce brighter disks with spectral indices lower than {$\sim$}2.5. Future multiwavelength high-resolution observations of these low-spectral-index sources can be used to test the existence of the ringed structures in the unresolved disks and differentiate the effects of dust size growth from optical depth.},

  abstract = {We perform a series of high-resolution 2D hydrodynamical simulations of equal-mass binary black holes (BBHs) embedded in active galactic nucleus (AGN) accretion disks to study whether these binaries can be driven to merger by the surrounding gas. We find that the gravitational softening adopted for the BBH has a profound impact on this result. When the softening is less than ten percent of the binary separation, we show that, in agreement with recent simulations of isolated equal-mass binaries, prograde BBHs expand in time rather than contract. Eventually, however, the binary separation becomes large enough that the tidal force of the central AGN disrupts them. Only when the softening is relatively large do we find that prograde BBHs harden. We determine through detailed analysis of the binary torque, that this dichotomy is due to a loss of spiral structure in the circum-single disks orbiting each BH when the softening is a significant fraction of the binary separation. Properly resolving these spirals \textendash{} both with high resolution and small softening \textendash{} results in a significant source of binary angular momentum. Only for retrograde BBHs do we find consistent hardening, regardless of softening, as these BBHs lack the important spiral structure in their circum-single disks. This suggests that the gas-driven inspiral of retrograde binaries can produce a population of compact BBHs in the gravitational-wave-emitting regime in AGN disks, which may contribute a large fraction to the observed BBH mergers.},

Here, {$\Sigma$}(r) is the surface mass density of the disk, {$\Omega$}(r) the angular rotation rate, S(r) the specific entropy, {$\Gamma$} the adiabatic index, and {$\kappa$}(r) the radial epicyclic frequency. The dispersion relation of the instability was shown to be similar to that of Rossby waves in planetary atmospheres. In this paper, we present the detailed linear theory of this Rossby wave instability and show that it exists for a wider range of conditions, specifically, for the case where there is a ``jump'' over some range of r in {$\Sigma$}(r) or in the pressure P (r). We elucidate the physical mechanism of this instability and its dependence on various parameters, including the magnitude of the ``bump'' or ``jump,'' the azimuthal mode number, and the sound speed in the disk. We find large parameter range where the disk is stable to axisymmetric perturbations, but unstable to the non-axisymmetric Rossby waves. We find that growth rates of the Rossby wave instability can be high, {$\sim$} 0.2{$\Omega$}K for relative small ``jumps'' or ``bumps''. We discuss possible conditions which can lead to this instability and the consequences of the instability.},

  abstract = {We study the nonlinear evolution of the Rossby wave instability in thin disks using global 2D hydrodynamic simulations. The key questions we are addressing in this paper are: (1) What happens when the instability becomes nonlinear? Specifically, does it lead to vortex formation? (2) What is the detailed behavior of a vortex? (3) Can the instability sustain itself and can the vortex last a long time? Among various initial equilibria that we have examined, we generally find that there are three stages of the disk evolution: (1) The exponential growth of the initial small amplitude perturbations. This is in excellent agreement with the linear theory; (2) The production of large scale vortices and their interactions with the background flow, including shocks. Significant accretion is observed due to these vortices. (3) The coupling of Rossby waves/vortices with global spiral waves, which facilitates further accretion throughout the whole disk. Even after more than 20 revolutions at the radius of vortices, we find that the disk maintains a state that is populated with vortices, shocks, spiral waves/shocks, all of which transport angular momentum outwards. We elucidate the physics at each stage and show that there is an efficient outward angular momentum transport in stages (2) and (3) over most parts of the disk, with an \$\textbackslash alpha\$ in the range from \$10\textasciicircum\{-4\}\$ to \$10\textasciicircum\{-2\}\$. We show why such vortices prove to be almost ideal ``units'' in transporting angular momentum outwards, namely by positively correlating the radial and azimuthal velocity components. We find some special cases in which entropy can remain the same while angular momentum is transported. We conclude that Rossby wave/vortex instability is an efficient, purely hydrodynamic mechanism for angular momentum transport in thin disks.}

Methods. First, we introduce the orbital evolution of Jupiter caused by the giant planet instability in the early Solar System. In this scenario, Jupiter could undergo an outward migration at a very high speed. We then investigate how such a jump changes the numbers of the L4 (N4) and L5 (N5) Trojans. Results. The outward migration of Jupiter can distort the co-orbital orbits near the Lagrangian points, resulting in L4 Trojans being more stable than the L5 ones. We find that, this mechanism could potentially explain the unbiased number asymmetry of N4/N5 1.6 for the known Jupiter Trojans. The uncertainties of the system parameters, e.g. Jupiter's eccentricity and inclination, the inclination distribution of Jupiter Trojans, are also taken into account and our results about the L4/L5 asymmetry have been further validated. However, the resonant amplitudes of the simulated Trojans are excited to higher values compared to the current population. A possible solution is that collisions among the Trojans may reduce their resonant amplitudes.},

  abstract = {Stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) embedded in active galactic nucleus (AGN) discs are possible progenitors of black-hole mergers detected in gravitational waves by LIGO/VIRGO. To better understand the hydrodynamical evolution of BBHs interacting with the disc gas, we perform a suite of high-resolution 2D simulations of binaries in local disc (shearing-box) models, considering various binary mass ratios, eccentricities and background disc properties. We use the {$\gamma$}-law equation of state and adopt a robust post-processing treatment to evaluate the mass accretion rate, torque and energy transfer rate on the binary to determine its long-term orbital evolution. We find that circular comparable-mass binaries contract, with an orbital decay rate of a few times the mass doubling rate. Eccentric binaries always experience eccentricity damping. Prograde binaries with higher eccentricities or smaller mass ratios generally have slower orbital decay rates, with some extreme cases exhibiting orbital expansion. The averaged binary mass accretion rate depends on the physical size of the accretor. The accretion flows are highly variable, and the dominant variability frequency is the apparent binary orbital frequency (in the rotating frame around the central massive BH) for circular binaries but gradually shifts to the radial epicyclic frequency as the binary eccentricity increases. Our findings demonstrate that the dynamics of BBHs embedded in AGN discs is quite different from that of isolated binaries in their own circumbinary discs. Furthermore, our results suggest that the hardening timescales of the binaries are much shorter than their migration timescales in the disc, for all reasonable binary and disc parameters.},

  abstract = {On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of 1.0\texttimes 10-21. It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1{$\sigma$}. The source lies at a luminosity distance of 410+160-180 Mpc corresponding to a redshift z=0.09+0.03-0.04. In the source frame, the initial black hole masses are 36+5-4M{$\odot$} and 29+4-4M{$\odot$}, and the final black hole mass is 62+4-4M{$\odot$}, with 3.0+0.5-0.5M{$\odot$}c2 radiated in gravitational waves. All uncertainties define 90\% credible intervals. These observations demonstrate the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black hole merger.}

  abstract = {Pebble accretion refers to the assembly of rocky planet cores from particles whose velocity dispersions are damped by drag from circumstellar disc gas. Accretion cross-sections can approach maximal Hill-sphere scales for particles whose Stokes numbers approach unity. While fast, pebble accretion is also lossy. Gas drag brings pebbles to protocores but also sweeps them past; those particles with the largest accretion cross-sections also have the fastest radial drift speeds and are the most easily drained out of discs. We present a global model of planet formation by pebble accretion that keeps track of the disc's mass budget. Cores, each initialized with a lunar mass, grow from discs whose finite stores of mm-cm sized pebbles drift inward across all radii in viscously accreting gas. For every 1 \$M\_\textbackslash oplus\$ netted by a core, at least 10 \$M\_\textbackslash oplus\$ and possibly much more are lost to radial drift. Core growth rates are typically exponentially sensitive to particle Stokes number, turbulent Mach number, and solid surface density. This exponential sensitivity, when combined with disc migration, tends to generate binary outcomes from 0.1-30 AU: either sub-Earth cores remain sub-Earth, or explode into Jupiters, with the latter migrating inward to varying degrees. When Jupiter-breeding cores assemble from mm-cm sized pebbles, they do so in discs where such particles drain out in \$\textbackslash sim\$10\$\textasciicircum 5\$ yr or less; such fast-draining discs do not fit mm-wave observations.},

  abstract = {THE recent discovery1 and confirmation2 of a possible planetary companion orbiting the solar-type star 51 Pegasi represent a breakthrough in the search for extrasolar planetary systems. Analysis of systematic variations in the velocity of the star indicate that the mass of the companion is approximately that of Jupiter, and that it is travelling in a nearly circular orbit at a distance from the star of 0.05 AU (about seven stellar radii). Here we show that, if the companion is indeed a gas-giant planet, it is extremely unlikely to have formed at its present location. We suggest instead that the planet probably formed by gradual accretion of solids and capture of gas at a much larger distance from the star (\textasciitilde 5 AU), and that it subsequently migrated inwards through interactions with the remnants of the circumstellar disk. The planet's migration may have stopped in its present orbit as a result of tidal interactions with the star, or through truncation of the inner circumstellar disk by the stellar magnetosphere.}

However, no CO depletion was found in the inner dust gap. To examine the planet\textendash disk interaction model, we present results of two-dimensional two fluid (gas + dust) hydrodynamic simulations coupled with three-dimensional radiative transfer simulations. In order to fit the high gas-to-dust ratio of the first gap, we find the Shakura\textendash Sunyaev viscosity parameter \$\textbackslash alpha\$ must be very small (\$\textbackslash lesssim 10\textasciicircum\{-4\}\$) in the inner disk. On the other hand, a relatively large \$\textbackslash alpha\$ (\$\textbackslash sim 7.5\textbackslash times 10\textasciicircum\{-3\}\$) is required to reproduce the dust surface density in the outer disk. We interpret the variation of \$\textbackslash alpha\$ as an indicator of the transition from an inner dead zone to the outer magnetorotational instability (MRI) active zone. Within \$\textbackslash sim 100\$ au, the HD 163296 disk's ionization level is low, and non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects could suppress the MRI, so the disk can be largely laminar. The disk's ionization level gradually increases toward larger radii, and the outermost disk (\$r {$>$} 300\$ au) becomes turbulent due to MRI. Under this condition, we find that the observed dust continuum and CO gas line emissions can be reasonably fit by three half-Jovian-mass planets (0.46, 0.46 and 0.58 \$M\_\textbackslash textrm\{J\}\$) at 59, 105 and 160 au, respectively.}

  abstract = {The secular behavior of an orbit under the gravitational perturbation due to a two-dimensional uniform disk is studied in this paper, through analytical and numerical approaches. We develop the secular approximation of this problem and obtain the averaged Hamiltonian for this system first. We find that, when the ratio of the semimajor axes of the inner orbit and the disk radius takes very small values (\$\textbackslash ll1\$), and if the inclination between the inner orbit and the disk is greater than the critical value of \$30\textasciicircum\textbackslash circ\$, the inner orbit will undergo the (classical) Lidov-Kozai resonance in which variations of eccentricity and inclination are usually very large and the system has two equilibrium points at \$\textbackslash omega=\textbackslash pi/2,3\textbackslash pi/2\$ (\$\textbackslash omega\$ is the argument of perihelion). The critical value will slightly drop to about \$27\textasciicircum\textbackslash circ\$ as the ratio increases to 0.4. However, the secular resonances will not occur for the outer orbit and the variations of the eccentricity and inclination are small. When the ratio of the orbit and the disk radius is nearly \$1\$, there are many more complicated Lidov-Kozai resonance types which lead to the orbital behaviors that are different from the classical Lidov-Kozai case. In these resonances, the system has more equilibrium points which could appear at \$\textbackslash omega=0,\textbackslash pi/2,\textbackslash pi,3\textbackslash pi/2\$, and even other values of \$\textbackslash omega\$. The variations of eccentricity and inclination become relatively moderate, moreover, in some cases the orbit can be maintained at a highly inclined state. In addition, a analysis shows that a Kuzmin disk can also lead to the (classical) Lidov-Kozai resonance and the critical inclination is also \$30\textasciicircum\textbackslash circ\$.},

  abstract = {We develop a pebble-driven model to study the formation and evolution of planets around stars in the mass range of 0.08 and 1 solar mass. The growth and migration of a large number of individual protoplanetary embryos are simulated in a population synthesis manner. We test two hypotheses for the birth locations of embryos: at the water ice line or log-uniformly distributed over entire protoplanetary disks. Two types of disks with different turbulent viscous parameters alpha of 1e-3 and 1e-4 are investigated, to shed light on the role of outward migration of protoplanets. The forming planets are compared with the observed exoplanets in terms of masses, semimajor axes, metallicities, and water contents. We find that gas giant planets are likely to form when the characteristic disk sizes are larger, the disk accretion rates are higher, the disks are more metal-rich and/or their stellar hosts are more massive. Our model shows that 1) the characteristic mass of super-Earth is set by the pebble isolation mass. Super-Earth masses increase linearly with the mass of its stellar host, corresponding to one Earth mass around a late M-dwarf star and 20 Earth masses around a solar-mass star. 2) The low-mass planets up to 20 Earth masses can form around stars with a wide range of metallicities, while massive gas giant planets are preferred to grow around metal-rich stars. 3) Super-Earth planets that are mainly composed of silicates, with relatively low water fractions can form from protoplanetary embryos at the water ice line in weakly turbulent disks where outward migration is suppressed. However, if the embryos are formed over a wide range of radial distances, the super-Earths would end up having a distinctive, bimodal composition in water mass. Our model succeeds in quantitatively reproducing several important observed properties of exoplanets and correlations with their stellar hosts.},

We propose that, at sufficiently high mass transfer rates such that the accretion disk around the companion becomes geometrically thick (or advection-dominated) near the disk outer radius, a large fraction of the transferred mass will be lost through the outer Lagrangian (L2) point. A physical model is constructed where the L2 mass loss fraction is given by the requirement that the remaining material in the disk has Bernoulli number equal to the L2 potential energy. Our model predicts significant L2 mass loss at mass transfer rates exceeding a few times 10{$^{-4}$} Msun/yr \textendash{} an equatorial circum-binary outflow (CBO) is formed in these systems. Implications for the orbital evolution and the observational appearance are discussed. In particular, (1) rapid angular momentum loss from the system tends to shrink the orbital separation and hence may increase the formation rate of mergers and gravitational-wave sources; (2) photons from the hot disk wind are reprocessed by the CBO into longer wavelength emission in the infrared bands, consistent with Spitzer observations of some ultra-luminous X-ray sources.},

  abstract = {Kepler has discovered hundreds of systems with multiple transiting exoplanets which hold tremendous potential both individually and collectively for understanding the formation and evolution of planetary systems. Many of these systems consist of multiple small planets with periods less than {$\sim$}50 days known as Systems with Tightly spaced Inner Planets, or STIPs. One especially intriguing STIP, Kepler-80 (KOI-500), contains five transiting planets: f, d, e, b, and c with periods of 1.0, 3.1, 4.6, 7.1, and 9.5 days, respectively. We provide measurements of transit times and a transit timing variation (TTV) dynamical analysis. We find that TTVs cannot reliably detect eccentricities for this system, though mass estimates are not affected. Restricting the eccentricity to a reasonable range, we infer masses for the outer four planets (d, e, b, and c) to be \{6.75\}-0.51+0.69, \{4.13\}-0.95+0.81, \{6.93\}-0.70+1.05, and \{6.74\}-0.86+1.23 Earth masses, respectively. The similar masses but different radii are consistent with terrestrial compositions for d and e and {$\sim$}2\% H/He envelopes for b and c. We confirm that the outer four planets are in a rare dynamical configuration with four interconnected three-body resonances that are librating with few degree amplitudes. We present a formation model that can reproduce the observed configuration by starting with a multi-resonant chain and introducing dissipation. Overall, the information-rich Kepler-80 planets provide an important perspective into exoplanetary systems.},

Their bulk densities span a large range, from those dense enough to be purely rocky to those needing a substantial contribution from volatiles to their volumes. Their orbital configurations range from compact, circular multitransiting systems like Kepler-11 to systems like our solar system's terrestrial planets with wider spacings and modest but significant eccentricities and mutual inclinations. Here we investigate whether a continuum of formation conditions resulting from variation in the amount of solids available in the inner disk can account for the diversity of orbital and compositional properties observed for super-Earths, including the apparent dichotomy between single and multitransiting systems. We simulate in situ formation of super-Earths via giant impacts and compare to the observed Kepler sample. We find that intrinsic variations among disks in the amount of solids available for in situ formation can account for the orbital and compositional diversity observed among Kepler's transiting planets. Our simulations can account for the planets' distributions of orbital period ratios, transit duration ratios, and transit multiplicity; higher eccentricities for planets in single transiting systems than for those in multitransiting systems; smaller eccentricities for larger planets; scatter in the mass\textendash radius relation, including lower densities for planets with masses measured with transit timing variations instead of with radial velocity; and similarities in planets' sizes and spacings within each system. Our findings support the theory that variation among super-Earth and mini-Neptune properties is primarily locked in by different in situ formation conditions, rather than arising stochastically through subsequent evolution.},

Early discoveries of giant exoplanets orbiting near their host stars and exoplanets in or near mean motion resonances were interpreted as evidence for migration and its crucial role in the beginnings of planetary systems. Long-scale migration has been invoked to explain systems of planets in mean motion resonant chains consisting of three or more planets linked by integer period ratios. However, recent studies have reproduced specific resonant chains in systems via short-scale migration, and eccentricity damping has been shown to capture planets into resonant chains. We investigate whether the observed resonant chains in Kepler-80, Kepler-223, Kepler-60, and TRAPPIST-1 can be established through long-scale migration, short-scale migration, and/or only eccentricity damping by running suites of N-body simulations. We find that, for each system, all three mechanisms are able to reproduce the observed resonant chains. Long-scale migration is not the only plausible explanation for resonant chains in these systems, and resonant chains are potentially compatible with in situ formation.},

We report new ALMA observations at 3 mm and analyze them together with archival 0.89 and 1.3 mm data. Our observations resolve three out of the four rings in the disk previously seen in high-resolution ALMA data. A simple parametric model is used to estimate the radial profile of the dust optical depth, temperature, density, and particle size distribution. We find that the multiple ring features of the disk are produced by annular accumulations of large particles, probably associated with gas pressure bumps. Our model indicates that the maximum dust grain size in the rings is {$\sim$} 1 cm, with slightly flatter power-law size distributions than the ISM-like size distribution (p {$\sim$} 3.5) found in the gaps. In particular, the inner ring ({$\sim$} 26 au) is associated with a strong and narrow buildup of dust particles that could harbor the necessary conditions to trigger the streaming instability. According to our analysis, the snowlines of the most important volatiles do not coincide with the observed substructures. We explore different ring formation mechanisms and find that planet-disk interactions are the most likely scenario to explain the main features of HD 169142. Overall, our multi-wavelength analysis provides some of the first unambiguous evidence of the presence of radial dust traps in the rings of HD 169142. A similar analysis in a larger sample of disks could provide key insights on the impact that disk substructures have on the dust evolution and planet formation processes.},

Classical theoretical analyses found in textbooks report that libration widths of first order mean motion resonances diverge for nearly circular orbits. Here we examine the nature of this divergence with a non-perturbative analysis of a few first order resonances interior to a Jupiter-mass planet. We show that a first order resonance has two branches, the pericentric and the apocentric resonance zone. As the eccentricity approaches zero, the centers of these zones diverge away from the nominal resonance location but their widths shrink. We also report a novel finding of "bridges" between adjacent first order resonances: at low eccentricities, the apocentric libration zone of a first order resonance smoothly connects with the pericentric libration zone of the neighboring first order resonance. These bridges may facilitate resonant migration across large radial distances in planetary systems, entirely in the low eccentricity regime.},

  abstract = {The origin of the highly eccentric, inclined, and resonance-locked orbit of Pluto has long been a puzzle. A possible explanation has been proposed recently [Malhotra, 1993, Nature, 365, 819] which suggests that these extraordinary orbital properties may be a natural consequence of the formation and early dynamical evolution of the outer solar system. A resonance capture mechanism is possible during the clearing of the residual planetesimal debris and the formation of the Oort Cloud of comets by planetesimal mass loss from the vicinity of the giant planets. If this mechanism were in operation during the early history of the planetary system, the entire region between the orbit of Neptune and approximately 50 AU would have been swept by first-order mean motion resonances. Thus, resonance capture could occur not only for Pluto, but quite generally for other trans-Neptunian small bodies. Some consequences of this evolution for the present-day dynamical structure of the trans-Neptunian region are (i) most of the objects in the region beyond Neptune and up to{\~ }50 AU exist in very narrow zones located at orbital resonances with Neptune (particularly the 3:2 and the 2:1 resonances); and (ii) these resonant objects would have significantly large eccentricities. The distribution of objects in the Kuiper Belt as predicted by this theory is presented here.},

  abstract = {We perform two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to quantitatively explore the torque balance criterion for gap-opening (as formulated by Crida et al. 2006) in a variety of disks when considering a migrating planet. We find that even when the criterion is satisfied, there are instances when planets still do not open gaps. We stress that gap-opening is not only dependent on whether a planet has the ability to open a gap, but whether it can do so quickly enough. This can be expressed as an additional condition on the gap-opening timescale versus the crossing time, i.e. the time it takes the planet to cross the region which it is carving out. While this point has been briefly made in the previous literature, our results quantify it for a range of protoplanetary disk properties and planetary masses, demonstrating how crucial it is for gap-opening. This additional condition has important implications for the survival of planets formed by core accretion in low mass disks as well as giant planets or brown dwarfs formed by gravitational instability in massive disks. It is particularly important for planets with intermediate masses susceptible to Type III-like migration. For some observed transition disks or disks with gaps, we expect that estimates on the potential planet masses based on the torque balance gap-opening criterion alone may not be sufficient. With consideration of this additional timescale criterion theoretical studies may find a reduced planet survivability or that planets may migrate further inwards before opening a gap.},

The evolution of the SMBHs and the surrounding galaxies is followed self-consistently from the large-scale merger down to the final few orbits before the black holes coalesce. Post-Newtonian corrections are included up to PN3.5-level for the binary dynamics, and the GW calculations include the corresponding corrections up to PN1.0-level. We analyze the significance of the stellar environment on the evolution of the binary and the emitted GW signal during the final GW emission dominated phase of the binary hardening and inspiral. Our simulations are compared to semi-analytic models that have often been used for making predictions for the stochastic GW background emitted by SMBHs. We find that the commonly used semi-analytic parameter values produce large differences in merger timescales and eccentricity evolution, but result in only \$\textbackslash sim 10\textbackslash\%\$ differences in the GW spectrum emitted by a single binary at frequencies \$f\textbackslash gtrsim 10\textasciicircum\{-1\} \textbackslash, \textbackslash rm yr\textasciicircum\{-1\}\$, which are accessible by current pulsar timing arrays. These differences are in part caused by the strong effects of the SMBH binaries on the surrounding stellar population, which are not included in the semi-analytic models.},

Within the trans-Plutonian planets paradigm, the Planet Nine hypothesis has received much attention as a robust scenario to explain the observed clustering in physical space of the perihelia of seven ETNOs which also exhibit clustering in orbital pole position. Here, we revisit the subject of clustering in perihelia and poles of the known ETNOs using barycentric orbits, and study the visibility of the latest incarnation of the orbit of Planet Nine applying Monte Carlo techniques and focusing on the effects of the apsidal anti-alignment constraint. We provide visibility maps indicating the most likely location of this putative planet if it is near aphelion.

The orbital periods are nearly in the ratio of 2:1, unprecedented among major planets but common among moons and asteroids. Moreover, the axes of the elliptical orbits appear to be nearly aligned. The inner companion was not recognized previously owing to the 2:1 ratio of periods, which allowed its signature to masquerade as added orbital eccentricity of the outer planet. Dynamical simulations show that the system is stable within a subset of the observed orbital parameters. The stability may be provided by a mean-motion resonance and the apparent alignment of the major axes. These planets pose unsolved questions about their formation and dynamical evolution, which brought them within 0.08 AU of each other and locked them in resonance.

  abstract = {In evolved and dusty circumstellar discs, two planets with masses comparable to Jupiter and Saturn that migrate outwards while maintaining an orbital resonance can produce distinctive features in the dust distribution. Dust accumulates at the outer edge of the common gas gap, which behaves as a dust trap, where the local dust concentration is significantly enhanced by the planets outward motion. Concurrently, an expanding cavity forms in the dust distribution inside the planets orbits, because dust does not filter through the common gaseous gap and grain depletion in the region continues via inward drifting. There is no cavity in the gas distribution because gas can filter through the gap, although ongoing gas accretion on the planets can reduce the gas density in the inner disc. Such behaviour was demonstrated by means of simulations neglecting the effects of dust diffusion due to turbulence and of dust backreaction on the gas. Both effects may alter the formation of the dust peak at the gap outer edge and of the inner dust cavity, by letting grains filter through the dust trap. We performed high resolution hydrodynamical simulations of the coupled evolution of gas and dust species, the latter treated as pressureless fluids, in the presence of two giant planets. We show that diffusion and backreaction can change some morphological aspects of the dust distribution but do not alter some main features, such as the outer peak and the expanding inner cavity. These findings are confirmed for different parametrizations of gas viscosity.},

The sizes for graphite are estimated to vary from about 0.005 to about 1 micron, and the observed uniformity of extinction over the sky is explained in terms of a rather uniform power-law exponent, which could have resulted from a stochastic process in grain formation},

We found that while resonant chains were stable, they can be destabilized by a change of \$\textbackslash sim\$10\% in planetary mass. Such a mass evolution can occur by atmospheric escape due to photoevaporation. We also found that resonant chains can be broken by a stellar mass loss of \$\textbackslash lesssim1\$\%, which would be explained by stellar winds or coronal mass ejections.

  abstract = {We present simulations of low mass planet-disc interactions in inviscid three dimensional discs. We show that a wind-driven laminar accretion flow through the surface layers of the disc does not significantly modify the migration torque experienced by embedded planets. More importantly, we find that 3D effects lead to a dramatic change in the behaviour of the dynamical corotation torque compared to earlier 2D theory and simulations. Whereas it was previously shown that the dynamical corotation torque could act to slow and essentially stall the inward migration of a low mass planet, our results in 3D show that the dynamical corotation torque has the complete opposite effect and speeds up inward migration. Our numerical experiments implicate buoyancy resonances as the cause. These have two effects: (i) they exert a direct torque on the planet, whose magnitude relative to the Lindblad torque is measured in our simulations to be small; (ii) they torque the gas librating on horseshoe orbits in the corotation region and drive evolution of its vortensity, leading to the negative dynamical corotation torque. This indicates that at low turbulent viscosity, the detailed vertical thermal structure of the protoplanetary disc plays an important role in determining the migration behaviour of embedded planets. If this result holds up under more a refined treatment of disc thermal evolution, then it has important implications for understanding the formation and early evolution of planetary systems.},

Analysis of the binary black hole spin distribution may shed light on this mystery, offering a means of discriminating between different binary formation channels. Using the data from Advanced LIGO and Virgo's first and second observing runs, here we seek to carefully characterize the distribution of effective spin among binary black holes, hierarchically measuring the distribution's mean \$\textbackslash mu\$ and variance \$\textbackslash sigma\textasciicircum 2\$ while accounting for selection effects and degeneracies between spin and other black hole parameters. We demonstrate that the known population of binary black holes have spins that are both small, with \$\textbackslash mu \textbackslash sim 0\$, and very narrowly distributed, with \$\textbackslash sigma\textasciicircum 2 \textbackslash leq 0.07\$ at 95\% credibility. We then explore what these ensemble properties imply about the spins of individual binary black hole mergers, re-analyzing existing gravitational-wave events with a population-informed prior on their effective spin. The binary black hole GW170729, which previously excluded effective spin equal to zero, is now consistent with zero effective spin at \textasciitilde 10\% credibility. More broadly, we find that uninformative spin priors generally yield overestimates for the effective spin magnitudes of compact binary mergers.},

  abstract = {Surveys have revealed many multi-planet systems containing super-Earths and Neptunes in orbits of a few days to a few months. There is debate whether in situ assembly or inward migration is the dominant mechanism of the formation of such planetary systems. Simulations suggest that migration creates tightly packed systems with planets whose orbital periods may be expressed as ratios of small integers (resonances), often in a many-planet series (chain). In the hundreds of multi-planet systems of sub-Neptunes, more planet pairs are observed near resonances than would generally be expected, but no individual system has hitherto been identified that must have been formed by migration. Proximity to resonance enables the detection of planets perturbing each other. Here we report transit timing variations of the four planets in the Kepler-223 system, model these variations as resonant-angle librations, and compute the long-term stability of the resonant chain. The architecture of Kepler-223 is too finely tuned to have been formed by scattering, and our numerical simulations demonstrate that its properties are natural outcomes of the migration hypothesis. Similar systems could be destabilized by any of several mechanisms, contributing to the observed orbital-period distribution, where many planets are not in resonances. Planetesimal interactions in particular are thought to be responsible for establishing the current orbits of the four giant planets in the Solar System by disrupting a theoretical initial resonant chain similar to that observed in Kepler-223.}

  abstract = {Recent observations of protoplanetary disks, as well as simulations of planet-disk interaction, have suggested that a single planet may excite multiple spiral arms in the disk, in contrast to the previous expectations based on linear theory (predicting a one-armed density wave). We re-assess the origin of multiple arms in the framework of linear theory, by solving for the global two-dimensional response of a non-barotropic disk to an orbiting planet. We show that the formation of a secondary arm in the inner disk, at about half of the orbital radius of the planet, is a robust prediction of linear theory. This arm becomes stronger than the primary spiral at several tenths of the orbital radius of the planet. Several additional, weaker spiral arms may also form in the inner disk. On the contrary, a secondary spiral arm is unlikely to form in the outer disk. Our linear calculations, fully accounting for the global behavior of both the phases and amplitudes of perturbations, generally support the recently proposed WKB phase argument for the secondary arm origin (as caused by the intricacy of constructive interference of azimuthal harmonics of the perturbation at different radii). We provide analytical arguments showing that the process of a single spiral wake splitting up into multiple arms is a generic linear outcome of wave propagation in differentially rotating disks. It is not unique to planet-driven waves and occurs also in linear calculations of spiral wakes freely propagating with no external torques. These results are relevant for understanding formation of multiple rings and gaps in protoplanetary disks.}

  abstract = {Gravitational coupling between young planets and their parent disks is often explored using numerical simulations, which typically treat the disk thermodynamics in a highly simplified manner. In particular, many studies adopt the locally isothermal approximation, in which the disk temperature is a fixed function of the stellocentric distance. We explore the dynamics of planet-driven density waves in disks with more general thermodynamics, in which the temperature is relaxed towards an equilibrium profile on a finite cooling timescale \$t\_\{\textbackslash rm c\}\$. We use both linear perturbation theory and direct numerical simulations to examine the global structure of density waves launched by planets in such disks. A key diagnostic used in this study is the behavior of the wave angular momentum flux (AMF), which directly determines the evolution of the underlying disk. The AMF of free waves is constant for slowly cooling (adiabatic) disks, but scales with the disk temperature for rapidly cooling (and locally isothermal) disks. However, cooling must be extremely fast, with \$\textbackslash beta = \textbackslash Omega t\_\{\textbackslash rm c\} \textbackslash lesssim 10\textasciicircum\{-3\}\$ for the locally isothermal approximation to provide a good description of density wave dynamics in the linear regime (relaxing to \$\textbackslash beta \textbackslash lesssim 10\textasciicircum\{-2\}\$ when nonlinear effects are important). For intermediate cooling timescales, density waves are subject to a strong linear damping. This modifies the appearance of planet-driven spiral arms and the characteristics of axisymmetric structures produced by massive planets: in disks with \$\textbackslash beta \textbackslash approx 0.1\$ \textendash{} \$1\$, a near-thermal mass planet opens only a single wide gap around its orbit, in contrast to the several narrow gaps produced when cooling is either faster or slower.},

  abstract = {It has been recently suggested that the multiple concentric rings and gaps discovered by ALMA in many protoplanetary disks may be produced by a single planet, as a result of the complex propagation and dissipation of the multiple spiral density waves it excites in the disk. Numerical efforts to verify this idea have largely utilized the so-called locally isothermal approximation with a prescribed disk temperature profile. However, in protoplanetary disks this approximation does not provide an accurate description of the density wave dynamics on scales of tens of astronomical units. Moreover, we show that locally isothermal simulations tend to overestimate the contrast of ring and gap features, as well as misrepresent their positions, when compared to simulations in which the energy equation is evolved explicitly. This outcome is caused by the nonconservation of the angular momentum flux of linear perturbations in locally isothermal disks. We demonstrate this effect using simulations of locally isothermal and adiabatic disks (with essentially identical temperature profiles) and show how the dust distributions, probed by millimeter wavelength observations, differ between the two cases. Locally isothermal simulations may thus underestimate the masses of planets responsible for the formation of multiple gaps and rings on scales of tens of astronomical units observed by ALMA. We suggest that caution should be exercised in using the locally isothermal simulations to explore planet\textendash disk interaction, as well as in other studies of wave-like phenomena in astrophysical disks.},

As described by Tsang (2011), wave reflection at the inner disc boundary modifies the Type I migration torque on the planet, allowing migration to be halted before the planet reaches the inner edge of the disc. For low-viscosity discs (\$\textbackslash alpha \textbackslash lesssim 10\textasciicircum\{-3\}\$), planets may be trapped with semi-major axes as large as \$3-5\$ times the inner disc radius. In general, planets are trapped closer to the inner edge as either the planet mass or the disc viscosity parameter \$\textbackslash alpha\$ increases, and farther from the inner edge as the disc thickness is increased.

One possible origin for these asymmetries is dust trapping in vortices formed at the edges of dead zones. We carry out high-resolution, two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of this scenario, including the effects of dust feedback. We find that, although feedback weakens the vortices and slows down the process of dust accumulation, the dust distribution in the disk can nonetheless remain asymmetric for many thousands of orbits. We show that even after \$10\textasciicircum 4\$ orbits, or \$2.5\$ Myr when scaled to the parameters of Oph IRS 48 (a significant fraction of its age), the dust is not dispersed into an axisymmetric ring, in contrast to the case of a vortex formed by a planet. This is because accumulation of mass at the dead zone edge constantly replenishes the vortex, preventing it from being fully destroyed. We produce synthetic dust emission images using our simulation results. We find that multiple small clumps of dust may be distributed azimuthally. These clumps, if not resolved from one another, appear as a single large feature. A defining characteristic of a disk with a dead zone edge is that an asymmetric feature is accompanied by a ring of dust located about twice as far from the central star.},

The PI in the inner power-law region shows a deep minimum whose location seems to coincide with the point source at \textbackslash lambda = 7 mm. This can be regarded as another sign of a protoplanet in TZ. The observed radial profile of the PI is reproduced by a minimally flaring disk with an irregular surface density distribution or with an irregular temperature distribution or with the combination of both.

Resonant chains like Kepler-223 and Kepler-80 consist of a trio of planets with the three-body resonant angle librating and/or with a two-body resonant angle librating for each pair. Here we investigate whether close-in super-Earths and mini-Neptunes forming in situ can lock into resonant chains due to dissipation from a depleted gas disk. We simulate the giant impact phase of planet formation, including eccentricity damping from a gaseous disk, followed by subsequent dynamical evolution over tens of millions of years. In a fraction of simulated systems, we find that planets naturally lock into resonant chains. These planets achieve a chain of near-integer period ratios during the gas-disk stage, experience eccentricity damping that captures them into resonance, stay in resonance as the gas disk dissipates, and avoid subsequent giant impacts, eccentricity excitation, and chaotic diffusion that would dislodge the planets from resonance. Disk conditions that enable planets to complete their formation during the gas-disk stage enable those planets to achieve tight period ratios {$\leq$}2 and, if they happen to be near-integer period ratios, lock into resonance. Using the weighting of different disk conditions deduced by MacDonald et al. and forward modeling Kepler selection effects, we find that our simulations of in situ formation via oligarchic growth lead to a rate of observable trios with integer period ratios and librating resonant angles comparable to observed Kepler systems.},

  abstract = {Shadows in scattered light images of protoplanetary disks are a common feature and support the presence of warps or misalignments between disk regions. These warps are possibly due to an inclined (sub-)stellar companion embedded in the disk. We study the morphology of the protoplanetary disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 139614 based on the first scattered light observations of this disk, which we model with the radiative transfer code MCMax3D. We obtained J- and H-band observations in polarized scattered light with VLT/SPHERE that show strong azimuthal asymmetries. In the outer disk, beyond \textasciitilde 30 au, a broad shadow spans a range of \textasciitilde 240\{\textbackslash deg\} in position angle, in the East. A bright ring at \textasciitilde 16 au also shows an azimuthally asymmetric brightness, with the faintest side roughly coincidental with the brightest region of the outer disk. Additionally, two arcs are detected at \textasciitilde 34 au and \textasciitilde 50 au. We created a simple 4-zone approximation to a warped disk model of HD 139614 in order to qualitatively reproduce these features. The location and misalignment of the disk components were constrained from the shape and location of the shadows they cast. We find that the shadow on the outer disk covers a range of position angle too wide to be explained by a single inner misaligned component. Our model requires a minimum of two separate misaligned zones \textendash{} or a continuously warped region \textendash{} to cast this broad shadow on the outer disk. A small misalignment of \textasciitilde 4\{\textbackslash deg\} between adjacent components can reproduce most of the observed shadow features. Multiple misaligned disk zones, potentially mimicing a warp, can explain the observed broad shadows in the HD 139614 disk. A planetary mass companion in the disk, located on an inclined orbit, could be responsible for such a feature and for the dust depleted gap responsible for a dip in the SED.},

  abstract = {Hydrodynamical simulations of planet-disk interactions suggest that planets may be responsible for a number of the sub-structures frequently observed in disks in both scattered light and dust thermal emission. Despite the ubiquity of these features, direct evidence of planets embedded in disks and of the specific interaction features like spiral arms within planetary gaps still remain rare. In this study we discuss recent observational results in the context of hydrodynamical simulations in order to infer the properties of a putative embedded planet in the cavity of a transition disk. We imaged the transition disk SR 21 in H-band in scattered light with SPHERE/IRDIS and in thermal dust emission with ALMA band 3 (3mm) observations at a spatial resolution of 0.1". We combine these datasets with existing band 9 (430um) and band 7 (870um) ALMA continuum data. The Band 3 continuum data reveals a large cavity and a bright ring peaking at 53 au strongly suggestive of dust trapping.The ring shows a pronounced azimuthal asymmetry, with a bright region in the north-west that we interpret as a dust over-density. A similarly-asymmetric ring is revealed at the same location in polarized scattered light, in addition to a set of bright spirals inside the mm cavity and a fainter spiral bridging the gap to the outer ring. These features are consistent with a number of previous hydrodynamical models of planet-disk interactions, and suggest the presence of a \textasciitilde 1 MJup planet at 44 au and PA=11\textdegree. This makes SR21 the first disk showing spiral arms inside the mm cavity, as well as one for which the location of a putative planet can be precisely inferred. With the location of a possible planet being well-constrained by observations, it is an ideal candidate for follow-up observations to search for direct evidence of a planetary companion still embedded in its disk.},

We investigate these effects with a combination of semi-analytic models of the resonance and numerical integrations. We also consider the case of the disk's dispersal, which can excite significant libration amplitude and can cause ejection from resonance for large enough precession rates. Both of these effects have implications for interpreting the known exoplanet population and may prove to be important considerations as the population of well-characterized exoplanet systems continues to grow.},

They result from a compact object, such as a stellar-mass black-hole (BH), captured by a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Several physical processes have been proposed to form EMRIs. In particular, weak two-body interactions over a long time scale (i.e., relaxation processes) have been proposed as a likely mechanism to drive the BH orbit to high eccentricity. Consequently, it is captured by the SMBH and becomes an EMRI. Here we demonstrate that EMRIs are naturally formed in SMBH binaries. Gravitational perturbations from an SMBH companion, known as the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism, combined with relaxation processes, yield a significantly more enhanced rate than any of these processes operating alone. Since EKL is sensitive to the orbital configuration, two-body relaxation can alter the orbital parameters, rendering the system in a more EKL-favorable regime. As SMBH binaries are expected to be prevalent in the Universe, this process predicts a substantially high EMRI rate.},

  abstract = {The apparent clustering in longitude of perihelion \$\textbackslash varpi\$ and ascending node \$\textbackslash Omega\$ of extreme trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs) has been attributed to the gravitational effects of an unseen 5-10 Earth-mass planet in the outer solar system. To investigate how selection bias may contribute to this clustering, we consider 14 ETNOs discovered by the Dark Energy Survey, the Outer Solar System Origins Survey, and the survey of Sheppard and Trujillo. Using each survey's published pointing history, depth, and TNO tracking selections, we calculate the joint probability that these objects are consistent with an underlying parent population with uniform distributions in \$\textbackslash varpi\$ and \$\textbackslash Omega\$. We find that the mean scaled longitude of perihelion and orbital poles of the detected ETNOs are consistent with a uniform population at a level between \$17\textbackslash\%\$ and \$94\textbackslash\%\$, and thus conclude that this sample provides no evidence for angular clustering.},

  abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard cold dark matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fitted over two decades in radius by scaling a simple "universal" profile. The characteristic over- density of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way that reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii but are significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper than r-2 near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies. The first problem may imply that the core structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the galaxy formation process, and the second problem may imply that galaxies failed to form (or remain undetected) in many dark halos.},

We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

  abstract = {(Abridged) Studies have shown that a Jovian mass planet embedded in a viscous protoplanetary disc (PPD) can accrete gas efficiently through the gap and doubles its mass in \$\textbackslash sim 0.1\$ Myr. The planet also migrates inwards on a timescale of \$\textbackslash sim 0.1\$ Myr. These timescales are short compared to PPD lifetimes, and raise questions about the origins of cold giant exoplanets. However, PPDs are unlikely to be globally turbulent, and instead they may launch magnetised winds such that accretion towards the star occurs in laminar accretion flows located in narrow layers near the surfaces of the disc. The aim of this study is to examine the rate at which gas accretes onto Jovian mass planets that are embedded in layered PPDs. We use 3D hydrodynamical simulations of planets embedded in PPDs, in which a constant radial mass flux towards the star of \$\{\textbackslash dot m\} = 10\^\{-8\}\$ M\$\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ yr\$\^\{-1\}\$ is sustained. We consider a classical viscous alpha model, and also models in which an external torque is applied in narrow surface layers to mimic the effects of a magnetised wind. The accreting layers are parameterised by their column densities \$\textbackslash Sigma\_\{\textbackslash rm A\}\$, and we consider values in the range 0.1 to 10 g cm\$\^\{-2\}\$. The viscous model gives results in agreement with previous studies. We find the accretion rate onto the planet in the layered models crucially depends on the planet's ability to block the wind-induced mass flow. For \$\textbackslash Sigma\_\{\textbackslash rm A\}=10\$ g cm\$\^\{-2\}\$, the planet torque can block the mass flow through the disc, accretion onto the planet is slow, and a mass doubling time of 10 Myr is obtained. For \$\textbackslash Sigma\_\{\textbackslash rm A\}=0.1\$ g cm\$\^\{-2\}\$, accretion is fast and the mass doubling time is 0.2 Myr. Although the radial mass flow through the layered disc models is always \$10\^\{-8\}\$ M\$\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ yr\$\^\{-1\}\$, adopting different values of \$\textbackslash Sigma\_\{\textbackslash rm A\}\$ leads to very different gas accretion rates onto gas giant planets.},

Many Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) exhibit significant TTVs, but KOI-142.01 stands out among them with an unrivaled {$\simeq$}12 hr TTV amplitude. Here we report a thorough analysis of KOI-142.01's transits. We discover periodic transit duration variations (TDVs) of KOI-142.01 that are nearly in phase with the observed TTVs. We show that KOI-142.01's TTVs and TDVs uniquely detect a non-transiting companion with a mass {$\simeq$}0.63 that of Jupiter (KOI-142c). KOI-142.01's mass inferred from the transit variations is consistent with the measured transit depth, suggesting a Neptune-class planet (KOI-142b). The orbital period ratio Pc /Pb = 2.03 indicates that the two planets are just wide of the 2:1 resonance. The present dynamics of this system, characterized here in detail, can be used to test various formation theories that have been proposed to explain the near-resonant pairs of exoplanets.},

  abstract = {These lecture notes and example problems are based on a course given at the University of Cambridge in Part III of the Mathematical Tripos. Fluid dynamics is involved in a very wide range of astrophysical phenomena, such as the formation and internal dynamics of stars and giant planets, the workings of jets and accretion discs around stars and black holes, and the dynamics of the expanding Universe. Effects that can be important in astrophysical fluids include compressibility, self-gravitation and the dynamical influence of the magnetic field that is 'frozen in' to a highly conducting plasma. The basic models introduced and applied in this course are Newtonian gas dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for an ideal compressible fluid. The mathematical structure of the governing equations and the associated conservation laws are explored in some detail because of their importance for both analytical and numerical methods of solution, as well as for physical interpretation. Linear and nonlinear waves, including shocks and other discontinuities, are discussed. The spherical blast wave resulting from a supernova, and involving a strong shock, is a classic problem that can be solved analytically. Steady solutions with spherical or axial symmetry reveal the physics of winds and jets from stars and discs. The linearized equations determine the oscillation modes of astrophysical bodies, as well as determining their stability and their response to tidal forcing.}

In the local model, inclination of the orbit of a test particle with respect to the reference orbit corresponds to a vertical oscillation of the particle at the orbital frequency. Warping of a disc corresponds to a locally axisymmetric corrugation of the midplane of the disc that oscillates vertically at the orbital frequency, while evolution of the warp corresponds to a modulation of the complex amplitude of the vertical oscillation. We derive a conservation law for this amplitude that is the local equivalent of the conservation of angular momentum and therefore governs the evolution of the warp. For lengthscales that are long compared to the vertical scaleheight of the disc, the known non-resonant and resonant regimes of warp dynamics, including the diffusive and wavelike regimes of Keplerian discs, occur in the local model in the same way as in a global view of warped discs.},

We investigate the conditions for dust-gap formation in terms of particle size and planetary mass. We also monitor the amount of dust that is accreted by the planet relative to the amount of gas, which is an important parameter in determining the enrichment of solids in giant planets compared to the solid content of the central star. Methods. We use a new two-fluid hydrodynamics code to solve the flow equations for both gas and dust. For the gas, we use a Godunov-type scheme with an approximate Riemann solver (the Roe solver). The dust is treated as a pressureless fluid by essentially the same numerical method as is used for the gas. Results. We find that it only takes a planet of 0.05 Jupiter masses to open up a gap in a disk with a significant population of mm-sized particles. Dust particles larger than 150 \textmu m participate in gap formation. We also find that the formation of the gap severely slows down dust accretion compared to that in the gas. Therefore, it is not possible to enrich a newly formed giant planet in solids, if these solids},

  abstract = {In this work, we investigate configuration formation of two inner terrestrial planets near mean motion resonance (MMRs) induced by the perturbation of a distant gas-giant for the Kepler-68 system, by conducting thousands of numerical simulations. The results show that the formation of terrestrial planets is relevant to the speed of Type I migration, the mass of planets, and the existence of giant planet. The mass and eccentricity of the giant planet may play a crucial role in shaping the final configuration of the system. The inner planet pair can be trapped in 5:3 or 7:4 MMRs if the giant planet revolves the central star with an eccentric orbit, which is similar to the observed configuration of Kepler-68. Moreover, we find that the eccentricity of the middle planet can be excited to roughly 0.2 if the giant planet is more massive than 5 \$M\_J\$,otherwise the terrestrial planets are inclined to remain near-circular orbits. Our study may provide a likely formation scenario for the planetary systems that harbor several terrestrial planets near MMRs inside and one gas-giant exterior to them.},

  abstract = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic radio transients of extraordinary luminosity. Studying the diverse temporal and spectral behaviour recently observed in a number of FRBs may help determine the nature of the entire class. For example, a fast spinning or highly magnetised neutron star might generate the rotation-powered acceleration required to explain the bright emission. Periodic, sub-second components, suggesting such rotation, were recently reported in one FRB, and potentially in two more. Here we report the discovery of FRB 20201020A with Apertif, an FRB showing five components regularly spaced by 0.415 ms. This sub-millisecond structure in FRB 20201020A carries important clues about the progenitor of this FRB specifically, and potentially about that of FRBs in general. We thus contrast its features to the predictions of the main FRB source models. We perform a timing analysis of the FRB 20201020A components to determine the significance of the periodicity. We compare these against the timing properties of the previously reported CHIME FRBs with sub-second quasi-periodic components, and against two Apertif bursts from repeating FRB 20180916B that show complex time-frequency structure. We find the periodicity of FRB 20201020A to be marginally significant at 2.5{$\sigma$}. Its repeating subcomponents cannot be explained as a pulsar rotation since the required spin rate of over 2 kHz exceeds the limits set by typical neutron star equations of state and observations. The fast periodicity is also in conflict with a compact object merger scenario. These quasi-periodic components could, however, be caused by equidistant emitting regions in the magnetosphere of a magnetar. The sub-millisecond spacing of the components in FRB 20201020A, the smallest observed so far in a one-off FRB, may rule out both neutron-star rotation and binary mergers as the direct source of quasi-periodic FRBs.},

  abstract = {We know little about the outermost exoplanets in planetary systems, because our detection methods are insensitive to moderate-mass planets on wide orbits. However, debris discs can probe the outer-planet population, because dynamical modelling of observed discs can reveal properties of perturbing planets. We use four sculpting and stirring arguments to infer planet properties in 178 debris-disc systems from the ISPY, LEECH and LIStEN planet-hunting surveys. Similar analyses are often conducted for individual discs, but we consider a large sample in a consistent manner. We aim to predict the population of wide-separation planets, gain insight into the formation and evolution histories of planetary systems, and determine the feasibility of detecting these planets in the near future. We show that a `typical' cold debris disc likely requires a Neptune- to Saturn-mass planet at 10-100 au, with some needing Jupiter-mass perturbers. Our predicted planets are currently undetectable, but modest detection-limit improvements (e.g. from JWST) should reveal many such perturbers. We find that planets thought to be perturbing debris discs at late times are similar to those inferred to be forming in protoplanetary discs, so these could be the same population if newly formed planets do not migrate as far as currently thought. Alternatively, young planets could rapidly sculpt debris before migrating inwards, meaning that the responsible planets are more massive (and located further inwards) than debris-disc studies assume. We combine self-stirring and size-distribution modelling to show that many debris discs cannot be self-stirred without having unreasonably high masses; planet- or companion-stirring may therefore be the dominant mechanism in many (perhaps all) debris discs. Finally, we provide catalogues of planet predictions, and identify promising targets for future planet searches.},

  abstract = {Physics invites the idea that space contains energy whose gravitational effect approximates that of Einstein's cosmological constant, Lambda; nowadays the concept is termed dark energy or quintessence. Physics also suggests the dark energy could be dynamical, allowing the arguably appealing picture that the dark energy density is evolving to its natural value, zero, and is small now because the expanding universe is old. This alleviates the classical problem of the curious energy scale of order a millielectronvolt associated with a constant Lambda. Dark energy may have been detected by recent advances in the cosmological tests. The tests establish a good scientific case for the context, in the relativistic Friedmann-Lemaitre model, including the gravitational inverse square law applied to the scales of cosmology. We have well-checked evidence that the mean mass density is not much more than one quarter of the critical Einstein-de Sitter value. The case for detection of dark energy is serious but not yet as convincing; we await more checks that may come out of work in progress. Planned observations might be capable of detecting evolution of the dark energy density; a positive result would be a considerable stimulus to attempts to understand the microphysics of dark energy. This review presents the basic physics and astronomy of the subject, reviews the history of ideas, assesses the state of the observational evidence, and comments on recent developments in the search for a fundamental theory.},

  abstract = {Almost all hydrodynamic accretion disk models parametrize viscosity with the dimensionless parameter alpha. There is no detailed model for alpha, so it is usually taken to be a constant. However, global simulations of magnetohydrodynamic disks find that alpha varies with distance from the central object. Also, Newtonian simulations tend to find smaller alpha's than general relativistic simulations. We seek a one-dimensional model for alpha that can reproduce these two observations. We are guided by data from six general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic accretion disk simulations. The variation of alpha in the inner, laminar regions of the flow results from stretching of mean magnetic field lines by the flow. The variation of alpha in the outer, turbulent regions results from the dependence of the magnetorotational instability on the dimensionless shear rate. We give a one-dimensional prescription for alpha(r) that captures these two effects and reproduces the radial variation of alpha observed in the simulations. For thin disks, the prescription simplifies to the formula alpha(r)=0.025[q(r)/1.5]\textasciicircum 6, where the shear parameter, q(r), is an analytical function of radius in the Kerr metric. The coefficient and exponent are inferred from our simulations and will change as better simulation data becomes available. We conclude that the alpha-viscosity prescription can be extended to the radially varying alpha's observed in simulations. It is possible that Newtonian simulations find smaller alpha's than general relativistic simulations because the shear parameter is lower in Newtonian flows.},

The disk resolves into a series of concentric rings and gaps together with a bright arc exterior to the rings that resembles hydrodynamics simulations of a vortex, and a bridge-like feature connecting the two innermost rings. Although our \$\textasciicircum\{12\}\$CO observations at similar spatial resolution do not show obvious substructure, they reveal an inner disk depleted of CO emission. From the continuum emission and the CO velocity field we find that the innermost ring has a higher inclination than the outermost rings and the arc. This is evidence for either a small (\$\textbackslash sim8\textasciicircum\{\textbackslash circ\}\$) or moderate (\$\textbackslash sim41\textasciicircum\{\textbackslash circ\}\$) misalignment between the inner and outer disk, depending on the specific orientation of the near/far sides of the inner/outer disk. We compare the observed substructures in the ALMA observations with recent scattered light data from VLT/SPHERE of this object. In particular, the location of narrow shadow lanes in the SPHERE image combined with pressure scale height estimates, favor a large misalignment of about \$41\textasciicircum\{\textbackslash circ\}\$. We discuss our findings in the context of a dust-trapping vortex, planet-carved gaps, and a misaligned inner disk due to the presence of an inclined companion to HD 143006.},

  abstract = {Rings and radial gaps are ubiquitous in protoplanetary disks, yet their possible connection to planet formation is currently subject to intense debates. In principle, giant planet formation leads to wide gaps that separate the gas and dust mass reservoir in the outer disk, while lower mass planets lead to shallow gaps that are manifested mainly on the dust component. We used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to observe the star HD 169142, host to a prominent disk with deep, wide gaps that sever the disk into inner and outer regions. The new ALMA high-resolution images allow for the outer ring to be resolved as three narrow rings. The HD 169142 disk thus hosts both the wide gap trait of transition disks and a narrow-ring system similar to those observed in the TW Hya and HL Tau systems. The mass reservoir beyond a deep gap can thus host ring systems. The observed rings are narrow in radial extent (width/radius of 1.5/57.3, 1.8/64.2, and 3.4/76.0 in au) and have asymmetric mutual separations: the first and middle ring are separated by 7 au while the middle and outermost ring are distanced by {$\sim$}12 au. Using hydrodynamical modeling we found that a simple explanation, involving a single migrating low-mass planet (10 M {$\oplus$}), entirely accounts for such an apparently complex phenomenon. Inward migration of the planet naturally explains the ring's asymmetric mutual separation. The isolation of HD 169142's outer rings thus allows a proof of concept to interpret the detailed architecture of the outer region of protoplanetary disks with low-mass planet formation of mini-Neptune's size, i.e., as in the protosolar nebula.},

  abstract = {K2-19b and c were among the first planets discovered by NASA's K2 mission and together stand in stark contrast with the physical and orbital properties of the solar system planets. The planets are between the size of Uranus and Saturn at 7.0 {$\pm$} 0.2 \{R\}\textbackslash oplus and 4.1 {$\pm$} 0.2 \{R\}\textbackslash oplus , respectively, and reside a mere 0.1\% outside the nominal 3:2 mean-motion resonance. They represent a different outcome of the planet formation process than the solar system, as well as the vast majority of known exoplanets. We measured the physical and orbital properties of these planets using photometry from K2, Spitzer, and ground-based telescopes, along with radial velocities from Keck/HIRES. Through a joint photodynamical model, we found that the planets have moderate eccentricities of e {$\approx$} 0.20 and well-aligned apsides {$\Delta\varpi$} {$\approx$} 0\textdegree. The planets occupy a strictly nonresonant configuration: the resonant angles circulate rather than librate. This defies the predictions of standard formation pathways that invoke convergent or divergent migration, both of which predict {$\Delta\varpi$} {$\approx$} 180\textdegree{} and eccentricities of a few percent or less. We measured masses of M p,b = 32.4 {$\pm$} 1.7 \{M\}\textbackslash oplus and M p,c = 10.8 {$\pm$} 0.6 \{M\}\textbackslash oplus . Our measurements, with 5\% fractional uncertainties, are among the most precise of any sub-Jovian exoplanet. Mass and size reflect a planet's core/envelope structure. Despite having a relatively massive core of \{M\}core\vphantom\{\} {$\approx$} 15 \{M\}\textbackslash oplus , K2-19b is envelope-rich, with an envelope mass fraction of roughly 50\%. This planet poses a challenge to standard models of core-nucleated accretion, which predict that cores {$\greaterequivlnt$}10 \{M\}\textbackslash oplus will quickly accrete gas and trigger runaway accretion when the envelope mass exceeds that of the core.},

A recent analysis of Transit-Timing Variations (TTVs) suggested b and c are close to but not in 3:2 mean motion resonance (MMR) because the classical resonant angles circulate. Such an architecture challenges our understanding of planet formation. Indeed, planet migration through the protoplanetary disk should lead to a capture into the MMR. Here, we show that the planets are in fact, locked into the 3:2 resonance despite circulation of the conventional resonant angles and aligned periapses. However, we show that such an orbital configuration cannot be maintained for more than a few hundred million years due to the tidal dissipation experienced by planet d. The tidal dissipation remains efficient because of a secular forcing of the innermost planet eccentricity by planets b and c. While the observations strongly rule out an orbital solution where the three planets are on close to circular orbits, it remains possible that a fourth planet is affecting the TTVs such that the four planet system is consistent with the tidal constraints.},

In this work, I propose the first general integrable model for first-order three-planet mean motion resonances. I show that one can generalize the strategy proposed in the two-planet case to obtain a one degree of freedom Hamiltonian. The dynamics of these resonances are governed by the second fundamental model of resonance. The model is valid for any mass ratio between the planets and for every first-order resonance.

  abstract = {The recent characterization of transiting close-in planets has revealed an intriguing population of sub-Neptunes with highly tilted and even polar orbits relative to their host star's equator. Any viable theory for the origin of these close-in, polar planets must explain (1) the observed stellar obliquities, (2) the substantial eccentricities, and (3) the existence of Jovian companions with large mutual inclinations. In this work, we propose a theoretical model that satisfies these requirements without invoking tidal dissipation or large primordial inclinations. Instead, tilting is facilitated by the protoplanetary disk dispersal during the late stage of planet formation, initiating a process of resonance sweeping and parametric instability. This mechanism consists of two steps. First, a nodal secular resonance excites the inclination to large values; then, once the inclination reaches a critical value, a linear eccentric instability is triggered, which detunes the resonance and ends inclination growth. The critical inclination is pushed to high values by general relativistic precession, making polar orbits an inherently post-Newtonian outcome. Our model predicts that polar, close-in subNeptunes coexist with cold Jupiters in low stellar obliquity orbits.},

Methods: We use coagulation/fragmentation and disk-structure models, to simulate the evolution of dust in a bumpy surface density profile, which we mimic with a sinusoidal disturbance. For different values of the amplitude and length scale of the bumps, we investigate the ability of this model to produce and retain large particles on million-year timescales. In addition, we compare the pressure inhomogeneities considered in this work with the pressure profiles that come from magnetorotational instability. Using the Common Astronomy Software Applications ALMA simulator, we study whether there are observational signatures of these pressure inhomogeneities that can be seen with ALMA. Results: We present the conditions required to trap dust particles and the corresponding calculations predicting the spectral slope in the mm-wavelength range, to compare with current observations. Finally, we present simulated images using different antenna configurations of ALMA at different frequencies, to show that the ring structures will be detectable at the distances of either the Taurus Auriga or Ophiucus star-forming regions.},

  abstract = {The past 5 years have dramatically changed our view of the disks of gas and dust around young stars. Observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and extreme adaptive optics systems have revealed that disks are dynamical systems. Most disks contain resolved structures, both in gas and dust, including rings, gaps, spirals, azimuthal dust concentrations, shadows cast by misaligned inner disks, as well as deviations from Keplerian rotation. The origin of these structures and how they relate to the planet formation process remain poorly understood. Spatially resolved kinematic studies offer a new and necessary window to understand and quantify the physical processes (turbulence, winds, radial and meridional flows, stellar multiplicity, instabilities) at play during planet formation and disk evolution. Recent progress, driven mainly by resolved ALMA observations, includes the detection and mass determination of embedded planets, the mapping of the gas flow around the accreting planets, the confirmation of tidal interactions and warped disk geometries, and stringent limits on the turbulent velocities. In this chapter, we will review our current understanding of these dynamical processes and highlight how kinematic mapping provides new ways to observe planet formation in action.},

  abstract = {The past 5 years have dramatically changed our view of the disks of gas and dust around young stars. Observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and extreme adaptive optics systems have revealed that disks are dynamical systems. Most disks contain resolved structures, both in gas and dust, including rings, gaps, spirals, azimuthal dust concentrations, shadows cast by misaligned inner disks, as well as deviations from Keplerian rotation. The origin of these structures and how they relate to the planet formation process remain poorly understood. Spatially resolved kinematic studies offer a new and necessary window to understand and quantify the physical processes (turbulence, winds, radial and meridional flows, stellar multiplicity, instabilities) at play during planet formation and disk evolution. Recent progress, driven mainly by resolved ALMA observations, includes the detection and mass determination of embedded planets, the mapping of the gas flow around the accreting planets, the confirmation of tidal interactions and warped disk geometries, and stringent limits on the turbulent velocities. In this chapter, we will review our current understanding of these dynamical processes and highlight how kinematic mapping provides new ways to observe planet formation in action.},

  abstract = {Recent observations have indicated a strong connection between compact (\$a \textbackslash lesssim 0.5\$ au) super-Earth and mini-Neptune systems and their outer (\$a \textbackslash gtrsim\$ a few au) giant planet companions. We study the dynamical evolution of such inner systems subject to the gravitational effect of an unstable system of outer giant planets, focussing on systems whose end configurations feature only a single remaining outer giant. In contrast to similar studies which used on N-body simulations with specific (and limited) parameters or scenarios, we implement a novel hybrid algorithm which combines N-body simulations with secular dynamics with aims of obtaining analytical understanding and scaling relations. We find that the dynamical evolution of the inner planet system depends crucially on \$N\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{ej\}\}\$, the number of mutual close encounters between the outer planets prior to eventual ejection/merger. When \$N\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{ej\}\}\$ is small, the eventual evolution of the inner planets can be well described by secular dynamics. For larger values of \$N\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{ej\}\}\$, the inner planets gain orbital inclination, inclination and eccentricity in a stochastic fashion analogous to Brownian motion. We develop a theoretical model, and compute scaling laws for the final orbital parameters of the inner system. We show that our model can account for the observed eccentric super-Earths/mini-Neptunes with inclined cold Jupiter companions, such as HAT-P-11, Gliese 777 and \$\textbackslash pi\$ Men.},

  abstract = {Gap formation in a gas disk triggered by disk-planet tidal interaction is considered. Density waves launched by the planet are assumed to be damped as a result of their nonlinear evolution leading to shock formation and its subsequent dissipation. As a consequence, wave angular momentum is transferred to the disk, leading to evolution of its surface density. Planetary migration is an important ingredient of the theory; effects of the planet-induced surface density perturbations on the migration speed are considered. A gap is assumed to form when a stationary solution for the surface density profile is no longer possible in the frame of reference migrating with the planet. An analytical limit on the planetary mass necessary to open a gap in an inviscid disk is derived. The critical mass turns out to be smaller than the mass M1 for which the planetary Hill radius equals the disk scale height by a factor of at least Q5/7 (Q is the Toomre stability parameter), depending on the strength of the migration feedback. In viscous disks the critical planetary mass could vary from \textasciitilde 0.2M1 to M1, depending on the disk viscosity. This implies that a gap could be formed by a planet with mass of 2-15 M{$\oplus$}, depending on the disk aspect ratio, viscosity, and the planet's location in the nebula.},

  abstract = {Recent sub-millimeter observations show non-axisymmetric brightness distributions with a horseshoe-like morphology for more than a dozen transition disks. The most accepted explanation for the observed asymmetries is the accumulation of dust in large-scale vortices. Protoplanetary disks vortices can form by the excitation of Rossby-wave instability in the vicinity of a steep pressure gradient, which can develop at the edges of a giant planet carved gap or at the edges of an accretionally inactive zone. We studied the formation and evolution of vortices formed in these two distinct scenarios by means of two-dimensional locally isothermal hydrodynamic simulations. We found that the vortex formed at the edge of a planetary gap is short-lived, unless the disk is nearly inviscid. In contrast, the vortex formed at the outer edge of a dead zone is long-lived. The vortex morphology can be significantly different in the two scenarios: the vortex radial and azimuthal extensions are \textasciitilde 1.5 and \textasciitilde 3.5 times larger for the dead zone edge compared to gap models. In some particular cases, the vortex aspect ratios can be similar in the two scenarios, however, the vortex azimuthal extensions can be used to distinguish the vortex formation mechanisms. We calculate predictions for vortex observability in the sub-millimeter continuum with ALMA. We found that the azimuthal and radial extent of brightness asymmetry correlates with vortex formation process, within the limitations of alpha-viscosity prescription.},

  abstract = {Idealized protoplanetary disk and giant planet formation models have been interpreted to suggest that a giant planet's atmospheric abundances can be used to infer its formation location in its parent protoplanetary disk. It has recently been reported that the hot Jupiter WASP-77 A b has sub-solar atmospheric carbon and oxygen abundances with a solar C/O abundance ratio. Assuming solar carbon and oxygen abundances for its host star WASP-77 A, WASP-77 A b's atmospheric carbon and oxygen abundances possibly indicate that it accreted its envelope interior to its parent protoplanetary disk's H2O ice line from carbon-depleted gas with little subsequent planetesimal accretion or core erosion. We comprehensively model WASP-77 A and use our results to better characterize WASP-77 A b. We show that the photospheric abundances of carbon and oxygen in WASP-77 A are super-solar with a sub-solar C/O abundance ratio, implying that WASP-77 A b's atmosphere has significantly sub-stellar carbon and oxygen abundances with a super-stellar C/O ratio. Our result possibly indicates that WASP-77 A b's envelope was accreted by the planet beyond its parent protoplanetary disk's H2O ice line. While numerous theoretical complications to these idealized models have now been identified, the possibility of non-solar protoplanetary disk abundance ratios confound even the most sophisticated protoplanetary disk and giant planet formation models. We therefore argue that giant planet atmospheric abundance ratios can only be meaningfully interpreted relative to the possibly non-solar mean compositions of their parent protoplanetary disks as recorded in the photospheric abundances of their solar-type dwarf host stars.},

However, numerical N-body experiments, especially those of planetary systems, are currently not reproducible. In the most optimistic scenario, they can only be replicated in an approximate or statistical sense. Even if authors share their full source code and initial conditions, differences in compilers, libraries, operating systems or hardware often lead to qualitatively different results. We provide a new set of easy-to-use, open-source tools that address the above issues, allowing for exact (bit-by-bit) reproducibility of N-body experiments. In addition to generating completely reproducible integrations, we show that our framework also offers novel and innovative ways to analyse these simulations. As an example, we present a high-accuracy integration of the Solar system spanning 10 Gyr, requiring several weeks to run on a modern CPU. In our framework, we can not only easily access simulation data at predefined intervals for which we save snapshots, but at any time during the integration. We achieve this by integrating an on-demand reconstructed simulation forward in time from the nearest snapshot. This allows us to extract arbitrary quantities at any point in the saved simulation exactly (bit-by-bit), and within seconds rather than weeks. We believe that the tools we present in this paper offer a new paradigm for how N-body simulations are run, analysed and shared across the community.},

It was designed for collisional dynamics such as planetary rings but can also solve the classical N-body problem. It is highly modular and can be customized easily to work on a wide variety of different problems in astrophysics and beyond. REBOUND comes with three symplectic integrators: leap-frog, the symplectic epicycle integrator (SEI) and a Wisdom-Holman mapping (WH). It supports open, periodic and shearing-sheet boundary conditions. REBOUND can use a Barnes-Hut tree to calculate both self-gravity and collisions. These modules are fully parallelized with MPI as well as OpenMP. The former makes use of a static domain decomposition and a distributed essential tree. Two new collision detection modules based on a plane-sweep algorithm are also implemented. The performance of the plane-sweep algorithm is superior to a tree code for simulations in which one dimension is much longer than the other two and in simulations which are quasi-two dimensional with less than one million particles. In this work, we discuss the different algorithms implemented in REBOUND, the philosophy behind the code's structure as well as implementation specific details of the different modules. We present results of accuracy and scaling tests which show that the code can run efficiently on both desktop machines and large computing clusters.},

  abstract = {Present and upcoming time-domain astronomy efforts, in part driven by gravitational-wave follow-up campaigns, will unveil a variety of rare explosive transients in the sky. Here, we focus on pulsational pair-instability evolution, which can result in signatures that are observable with electromagnetic and gravitational waves. We simulated grids of bare helium stars to characterize the resulting black hole (BH) masses together with the ejecta composition, velocity, and thermal state. We find that the stars do not react "elastically" to the thermonuclear ignition in the core: there is not a one-to-one correspondence between pair-instability driven ignition and mass ejections, which causes ambiguity as to what is an observable pulse. In agreement with previous studies, we find that for initial helium core masses of 37.5 M{$\odot$} {$\lessequivlnt$} MHe, init {$\lessequivlnt$} 41 M{$\odot$}, corresponding to carbon-oxygen core masses 27.5 M{$\odot$} {$\lessequivlnt$} MCO {$\lessequivlnt$} 30.1 M{$\odot$}, the explosions are not strong enough to affect the surface. With increasing initial helium core mass, they become progressively stronger causing first large radial expansion (41 M{$\odot$} {$\lessequivlnt$} MHe, init {$\lessequivlnt$} 42 M{$\odot$}, corresponding to 30.1 M{$\odot$} {$\lessequivlnt$} MCO {$\lessequivlnt$} 30.8 M{$\odot$}) and, finally, also mass ejection episodes (for MHe, init {$\greaterequivlnt$} 42 M{$\odot$}, or MCO {$\greaterequivlnt$} 30.8 M{$\odot$}). The lowest mass helium core to be fully disrupted in a pair-instability supernova is MHe, init {$\simeq$} 80 M{$\odot$}, corresponding to MCO {$\simeq$} 55 M{$\odot$}. Models with MHe, init {$\greaterequivlnt$} 200 M{$\odot$} (MCO {$\greaterequivlnt$} 114 M{$\odot$}) reach the photodisintegration regime, resulting in BHs with masses of MBH {$\greaterequivlnt$} 125 M{$\odot$}. Although this is currently considered unlikely, if BHs from these models form via (weak) explosions, the previously-ejected material might be hit by the blast wave and convert kinetic energy into observable electromagnetic radiation. We characterize the hydrogen-free circumstellar material from the pulsational pair-instability of helium cores by simply assuming that the ejecta maintain a constant velocity after ejection. We find that our models produce helium-rich ejecta with mass of 10-3 M{$\odot$} {$\lessequivlnt$} MCSM {$\lessequivlnt$} 40 M{$\odot$}, the larger values corresponding to the more massive progenitor stars. These ejecta are typically launched at a few thousand km s-1 and reach distances of {$\sim$}1012 - 1015 cm before the core-collapse of the star. The delays between mass ejection events and the final collapse span a wide and mass-dependent range (from subhour to 104 years), and the shells ejected can also collide with each other, powering supernova impostor events before the final core-collapse. The range of properties we find suggests a possible connection with (some) type Ibn supernovae.},

  abstract = {We present the most sensitive 3 mm-survey to date of protoplanetary disks carried out in the Taurus-Auriga star forming region (average rms of about 0.3 mJy), using the IRAM PdBI. With our high detection rate of 17/19 we provide the first detections at wavelengths longer than about 1 mm for 12 sources. This enables us to statistically study the mm SED slopes and dust properties of faint disks and compare them to brighter disks using a uniform analysis method. With these new data and literature measurements at sub-millimeter and millimeter wavelengths, we analyze the dust properties of a sample of 21 isolated disks around T Tauri stars in the Taurus-Auriga star forming region. Together with the information about the disks' spatial extension from sub/mm-mm interferometric studies, we derive from the observed sub-mm/mm spectral energy distribution constraints on the dust opacity law at these wavelengths, using two-layer flared disk models and a self-consistent dust model that properly takes into account the variation of the dust opacity with grain growth. We find evidence for the presence of dust particles in the disk midplane that have grown to sizes as large as at least 1 millimeter in all the disks of our sample, confirming what was previously observed on smaller brighter objects. This indicates that the dust coagulation from ISM dust to mm-sized grains is a very fast process in protoplanetary disks, which appears to occur before a young stellar object enters the class II evolutionary stage. The amount of these large grains in the disk outer regions is also found to be stationary throughout the whole class II evolutionary stage, which indicates that mechanisms slowing down the dust inward migration play an important role in the Taurus-Auriga protoplanetary disks. Another result is that the spectral index between 1 and 3 mm for the six faintest disks in our sample is on average smaller than for the brighter disks, indicating either that these fainter yet unmapped disks are spatially much less extended than the brighter spatially resolved disks, or that fainter disks have typically larger dust grains in their outer regions. Considering that these fainter disks are more representative of the bulk of the disk population than the brighter ones, this may have important consequences for the theories of planetesimal formation and disk formation and evolution. Finally, we investigate the relations between the derived dust properties, namely dust mass and grain growth, and the properties of the central star, like its mass, age and mass accretion rate.},

We generate synthetic images for the dust continuum emission at sub-millimeter to centimeter wavelengths and simulate ALMA and ngVLA observations. We explore the parameter space of some of the main disk and planet properties that would produce substructures that can be visible with ALMA and the ngVLA.

The ngVLA can measure the proper motion of azimuthal asymmetric structures associated with the disk-planet interaction, as well as possible circumplanetary disks on timescales as short as one to a few weeks for planets at \$1 - 5\$ au from the star.},

  abstract = {The discovery of 'Oumuamua (1I/2017 U1), the first interstellar interloper, suggests an abundance of free-floating small bodies whose ejection into galactic space cannot be explained by the current population of confirmed exoplanets. Shortly after 'Oumuamua's discovery, observational results from the DSHARP survey illustrated the near-ubiquity of ring/gap substructures within protoplanetary disks, strongly suggesting the existence of a vast population of as-yet undetected wide-separation planets that are capable of efficiently ejecting debris from their environments. These planets have a 5 au and masses of order Neptune's or larger, and they may accompany {$\sim$}50\% of newly formed stars (Zhang et al. 2018). We combine the DSHARP results with statistical constraints from current timedomain surveys to quantify the population of detectable icy planetesimals ejected by disk-embedded giant planets through gravity assists. Assessment of the expected statistical distribution of interstellar objects is critical to accurately plan for and interpret future detections. We show that the number density of interstellar objects implied by 'Oumuamua is consistent with 'Oumuamua itself having originated as an icy planetesimal ejected from a DSHARP-type system via gravity assists, with the caveat that 'Oumuamua's lack of observed outgassing remains in strong tension with a cometary origin. Under this interpretation, 'Oumuamua's detection points towards a large number of long-period giant planets in extrasolar systems, supporting the hypothesis that the observed gaps in protoplanetary disks are carved by planets. In the case that 'Oumuamua is an ejected cometary planetesimal, we conclude that LSST should detect up to a few interstellar objects per year of 'Oumuamua's size or larger and over 100 yr-1 for objects with r {$>$} 1 m.},

  abstract = {Large-scale persistent vortices could play a key role in the evolution of protoplanetary disks, particularly in the dead zone where no turbulence associated with a magnetic field is expected. These vortices are known to form easily in 2D disks via the Rossby wave or the baroclinic instability. In three dimensions, however, their formation and stability is a complex problem and still a matter of debate. We study the formation of vortices by the Rossby wave instability in a stratified inviscid disk and describe their 3D structure, stability, and long-term evolution. Numerical simulations were performed using a fully compressible hydrodynamical code based on a second-order finite volume method. We assumed a perfect-gas law and a non-homentropic adiabatic flow. The Rossby wave instability is found to proceed in 3D in a similarway as in 2D. Vortices produced by the instability look like columns of vorticity in the whole disk thickness; the weak vertical motions are related to the weak inclination of the vortex axis that appears during the development of the RWI. Vortices with aspect ratios higher than 6 are unaffected by the elliptical instability. They relax into a quasi-steady columnar structure that survives hundreds of rotations while slowly migrating inward toward the star at a rate that reduces with the vortex aspect ratio. Vortices with a lower aspect ratio are by contrast affected by the elliptic instability. Short aspect ratio vortices ({$\chi$} {$<$} 4) are completely destroyed in a few orbital periods. Vortices with an intermediate aspect ratio (4 {$<$} {$\chi$} {$<$} 6) are partially destroyed by the elliptical instability in a region away from the midplane where the disk stratification is sufficiently strong. Elongated Rossby vortices can survive many orbital periods in protoplanetary disks in the form of vorticity columns. They could play a significant role in the evolution of the gas and the gathering of solid particles to form planetesimals or planetary cores, a possibility that receives a renewed interest with the recent discovery of a particle trap in the disk of Oph IRS 48.},

Here, using a suite of 3-D hydrodynamics simulations, we explore the outcome of close interactions between 1M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}} stars and binary black holes (BBHs) in the gravitational wave regime, resulting in a tidal disruption event (TDE) or a pure scattering, focusing on the accretion rates, the back reaction on the BH binary orbital parameters and the increase in the binary BH effective spin. We find that TDEs can make a significant impact on the binary orbit, which is often different from that of pure scattering. Binaries experiencing a prograde (retrograde) TDE tend to be widened (hardened) by up to {$\simeq$}20\%. Initially circular binaries become more eccentric by 10\% by a prograde or retrograde TDE, whereas the eccentricity of initially eccentric binaries increases (decreases) by a retrograde (prograde) TDE by 5\%. Overall a single TDE can generally result in changes of the gravitational wave-driven merger time scale by order unity. The accretion rates of both black holes are very highly super-Eddington, showing modulations (preferentially for retrograde TDEs) on a time scale of the orbital period, which can be a characteristic feature of BBH-driven TDEs. Prograde TDEs result in the effective spin parameter {$\chi$} to vary by 0.02 while {$\chi$}-0.005 for retrograde TDEs.},

Each of these formation channels, and their sub-channels, populate a distinct region in the effective spin-mass (\$\textbackslash chi\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\}-M\$) plane. Depending on the branching ratio of different channels, an ensemble of BBHs could show a trend in this plane. Here we fit a mass-dependent distribution for \$\textbackslash chi\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\}\$ to the GWTC-1 BBHs from the first and second observing runs of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo.

This trend is robust against the choice of mass variable, but most pronounced when the mass variable is taken to be the chirp mass of the binary. The result is consistent with significant contributions from both dynamically assembled and field binaries in the GWTC-1 catalog. The upcoming LIGO O3a data release will critically test this interpretation.},

Earlier it was found that masses of the largest bodies in the Earth's zone had to be of the order of 10-3-10-2 of the Earth's mass. On the contrary Marcus has found that the masses of the largest bodies were comparable with the mass m0 of the planet (up to 12 m0). In the present paper it is shown that this result is a direct consequence of an inverse power law assumed by Marcus for the mass distribution of all bodies including the largest one. A very simple method of estimation of the ratios mkmk+1 found by Marcus with the aid of limit theorems of the theory of probability is given. The suggestion by Marcus that the collision speeds of bodies were much lower than the velocity of escape at their surfaces, made to avoid contradiction with the data on the planetary rotation, is untenable. However the inverse power law found for small bodies is not valid for the largest bodies. Owing to gravitation the effective cross sections of large bodies considerably exceed their geometrical cross sections and their ratios are proportional to the fourth power of the ratios of the radii of bodies. It is found that the ratio m0m1 of the mass of the first largest body to that of the second one moving in the same zone increased with time, approaching some limit that depended on the relative velocities of bodies and was of the order of 103. This figure agrees with the value found from the data on the planetary rotation. The largest bodies m0 had nearly circular orbits around the Sun and determined the relative velocities of other bodies in their zones. They may be considered as planet ``embryos'' At an early stage there were many such ``embryos'' in the zone of the formation of the planet, because their masses were small and their feeding zones were narrow. The masses of the embryos increased, adjacent zones became overlapped, and the smaller embryos fragmented or were absorbed by larger ones. The greatest embryos gradually have grown up into the present planets.},

We study the problem through 2D long-time simulations of systems consistent with type II regime, using the hydrodynamical grid code FARGO3D. Even though our simulations confirm the presence of an initial phase characterised by fast migration, they also reveal that the migration velocity slows down and eventually reaches the theoretical prediction if we allow the system to evolve for enough time. We find the same tendency to evolve towards the theoretical predictions at later times when we analyse the mass flow through the gap and the torques acting on the planet. This transient is related to the initial conditions of our (and previous) simulations, and is due to the fact that the shape of the gap has to adjust to a new profile, once the planet is set into motion. Secondly, we test whether the type II theory expectation that giant planet migration is driven by viscosity is consistent with our simulation by comparing simulations with the same viscosity and different disc mass (or viceversa). We find a good agreement with the theory, since when the discs are characterised by the same viscosity, the migration properties are the same.},

It has been suggested that merging of main-sequence and pre-main-sequence stars could produce such strong fields4,5, and the predicted fraction of merged massive stars is also about ten per cent6,7. The merger hypothesis is further supported by a lack of magnetic stars in close binaries8,9, which is as expected if mergers produce magnetic stars. Here we report three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the coalescence of two massive stars and follow the evolution of the merged product. Strong magnetic fields are produced in the simulations, and the merged star rejuvenates such that it appears younger and bluer than other coeval stars. This can explain the properties of the magnetic `blue straggler' star {$\tau$} Sco in the Upper Scorpius association that has an observationally inferred, apparent age of less than five million years, which is less than half the age of its birth association10. Such massive blue straggler stars seem likely to be progenitors of magnetars, perhaps giving rise to some of the enigmatic fast radio bursts observed11, and their supernovae may be affected by their strong magnetic fields12.},

  abstract = {It is generally accepted that the four major (Galilean) satellites formed out of the gas disk that accompanied Jupiter's formation. However, understanding the specifics of the formation process is challenging as both small particles (pebbles) as well as the satellites are subject to fast migration processes. Here, we hypothesize a new scenario for the origin of the Galilean system, based on the capture of several planetesimal seeds and subsequent slow accretion of pebbles. To halt migration, we invoke an inner disk truncation radius, and other parameters are tuned for the model to match physical, dynamical, compositional, and structural constraints. In our scenario it is natural that Ganymede's mass is determined by pebble isolation. Our slow-pebble-accretion scenario then reproduces the following characteristics: (1) the mass of all the Galilean satellites; (2) the orbits of Io, Europa, and Ganymede captured in mutual 2:1 mean motion resonances; (3) the ice mass fractions of all the Galilean satellites; (4) the unique ice-rock partially differentiated Callisto and the complete differentiation of the other satellites. Our scenario is unique to simultaneously reproduce these disparate properties.},

The origin of this enrichment and whether it represent the bulk composition of the planetary envelope remain unknown. Internal structure models of Jupiter suggest that its envelope is separated from the deep interior and that the planet is not fully mixed. This implies that Jupiter's atmosphere was enriched with heavy elements just before the end of its formation. Such enrichment can be a result of late planetesimal accretion. However, in-situ Jupiter formation models suggest the decreasing accretion rate with increasing planetary mass, which cannot explain Jupiter's atmospheric enrichment. In this study, we model Jupiter's formation and show that an migration of proto-Jupiter from {$\sim$} 20 AU to its current location can lead to a late planetesimal accretion and atmospheric enrichment. Late planetesimal accretion does not occur if proto-Jupiter migrates only a few AU. We suggest that if Jupiter's outermost layer is fully-mixed and is relatively thin (up to {$\sim$} 20\% of its mass), such late accretion can explain its measured atmospheric composition. It is therefore possible that Jupiter underwent significant orbital migration followed by late planetesimal accretion.},

  abstract = {Resonant planetary systems contain at least one planet pair with orbital periods librating at a nearinteger ratio (2/1, 3/2, 4/3, etc.) and are a natural outcome of standard planetary formation theories. Systems with multiple adjacent resonant pairs are known as resonant chains and can exhibit threebody resonances \textemdash characterized by a critical three-body angle. Here we study three-body angles as a diagnostic of resonant chains through tidally-damped N-body integrations. For each combination of the 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, and 5:4 mean motion resonances (the most common resonances in the known resonant chains), we characterize the three-body angle equilibria for several mass schemes, migration timescales, and initial separations. We find that under our formulation of the three-body angle, which does not reduce coefficients, 180{$\smwhtcircle$} is the preferred libration center, and libration centers shifted away from 180{$\smwhtcircle$} are associated with non-adjacent resonances. We then relate these angles to observables, by applying our general results to two transiting systems: Kepler-60 and Kepler-223. For these systems, we compare N-body models of the three-body angle to the zeroth order in e approximation accessible via transit phases, used in previous publications. In both cases, we find the three-body angle during the Kepler observing window is not necessarily indicative of the long-term oscillations and stress the role of dynamical models in investigating three-body angles. We anticipate our results will provide a useful diagnostic in the analysis of resonant chains.},

  abstract = {We analytically derive the observed size-mass relation of galaxies' atomic hydrogen (HI), including limits on its scatter, based on simple assumptions about the structure of HI discs. We trial three generic profiles for HI surface density as a function of radius. Firstly, we assert that HI surface densities saturate at a variable threshold, and otherwise fall off exponentially with radius or, secondly, radius squared. Our third model assumes the total gas surface density is exponential, with the HI fraction at each radius depending on local pressure. These are tested against a compilation of 110 galaxies from the THINGS, LITTLE THINGS, LVHIS, and Bluedisk surveys, whose HI surface density profiles are well resolved. All models fit the observations well and predict consistent size-mass relations. Using an analytical argument, we explain why processes that cause gas disc truncation - such as ram-pressure stripping - scarcely affect the HI size-mass relation. This is tested with the IllustrisTNG(100) cosmological, hydrodynamic simulation and the Dark Sage semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, both of which capture radially resolved disc structure. For galaxies with m\_*{$>$}10\textasciicircum 9 M\_solar and m\_HI{$>$}10\textasciicircum 8 M\_solar, both simulations predict HI size-mass relations that align with observations, show no difference between central and satellite galaxies, and show only a minor, second-order dependence on host halo mass for satellites. Ultimately, the universally tight HI size-mass relation is mathematically inevitable and robust. Only by completely disrupting the structure of HI discs, e.g. through overly powerful feedback, could a simulation predict the relation poorly.},

In particular, to study habitability of galaxies represents one of the main emerging challenges of theoretical and numerical astrobiology. Its theoretical underpinnings are, however, often confused and vague. Here we present a systematic attempt to list and categorize major causal factors playing a role in emergent habitability of galaxies. Furthermore, we argue that the methodology of cosmological merger trees is particularly useful in delineating what are systematic and lawful astrobiological properties of galaxies at present epoch vs. those which are product of historical contingency and, in particular, interaction with wider extragalactic environment. Employing merger trees extracted from cosmological N-body simulations as a new and promising research method for astrobiology has been pioneered by Stanway et al. (2018). We analyse the general issue of applicability of merger trees and present preliminary results on a set of trees extracted from the Illustris Project. In a sense, this approach is directly complementary to using large-scale cosmological simulations to study habitable zones of individual galaxies with high mass/spatial resolution; taken together, they usher a new era of synergy and synthesis between cosmology and astrobiology.},

  abstract = {We study the radial migration of dust particles in accreting protostellar disks analogous to the primordial solar nebula. Our main objective is to determine the retention efficiency of dust particles, which are the building blocks of the much larger planetesimals. This study takes account of the two-dimensional (radial and normal) structure of the disk gas, including the effects of the variation in the gas velocity as a function of distance from the midplane. It is shown that the dust component of disks accretes slower than the gas component. At high altitude from the disk midplane (higher than a few disk scale heights), the gas rotates faster than the particles because of the inward pressure gradient force, and its drag force causes particles to move outward in the radial direction. Viscous torque induces the gas within a scale height from the disk midplane to flow outward, carrying small (size {$\lessequivlnt$} 100 {$\mu$}m at 10 AU) particles with it. Only particles at intermediate altitude or with sufficiently large sizes ({$\greaterequivlnt$}1 mm at 10 AU) move inward. When the particles' radial velocities are averaged over the entire vertical direction, the particles have a net inward flux. The magnitude of their radial motion depends on their distance from the central star. At large distances, particles migrate inward with a velocity much faster than the gas accretion velocity. However, their inward velocity is reduced below that of the gas in the inner regions of the disk. The rate of velocity decrease is a function of the particles' size. While larger particles retain fast accretion velocity until they approach closer to the star, 10 {$\mu$}m particles have slower velocity than the gas in the majority of the disk (r {$\lessequivlnt$} 100 AU). This differential migration of particles causes size fractionation. Dust disks composed mostly of small particles (size {$\lessequivlnt$} 10 {$\mu$}m) accrete slower than gas disks, resulting in an increase in the dust-gas ratio during the gas accretion phase. If the gas disk has a steep radial density gradient or if dust particles sediment effectively to the disk midplane, the net vertically averaged flux of particles can be outward. In this case, the accretion of the dust component is prevented, leading to the formation of residual dust disks after their gas component is severely depleted.},

  abstract = {We study the radial migration of dust particles in accreting protostellar disks analogous to the primordial solar nebula. This study takes account of the two dimensional (radial and normal) structure of the disk gas, including the effects of the variation in the gas velocity as a function of distance from the midplane. It is shown that the dust component of disks accretes slower than the gas component. At high altitude from the disk midplane, the gas rotates faster than particles because of the inward pressure gradient force, and its drag force causes particles to move outward in the radial direction. Viscous torque induces the gas within a scale height from the disk midplane to flow outward, carrying small (size {$<$} 100 micron at 10 AU) particles with it. Only particles at intermediate altitude or with sufficiently large sizes ({$>$} 1 mm at 10 AU) move inward. When the particles' radial velocities are averaged over the entire vertical direction, particles have a net inward flux. At large distances from the central star, particles migrate inward with a velocity much faster than the gas accretion velocity. However, their inward velocity is reduced below that of the gas in the inner regions of the disk. The rate of velocity decrease is a function of the particles' size. While larger particles retain fast accretion velocity until they approach closer to the star, 10 micron particles have slower velocity than the gas in the most part of the disk (r {$<$} 100 AU). This differential migration of particles causes the size fractionation. Dust disks composed mostly of small particles (size {$<$} 10 micron) accrete slower than gas disks, resulting in the increase in the dust-gas ratio during the gas accretion phase.}

  abstract = {We combine analytical understanding of resonant dynamics in two-planet systems with machine learning techniques to train a model capable of robustly classifying stability in compact multi-planet systems over long timescales of \$10\textasciicircum 9\$ orbits. Our Stability of Planetary Orbital Configurations Klassifier (SPOCK) predicts stability using physically motivated summary statistics measured in integrations of the first \$10\textasciicircum 4\$ orbits, thus achieving speed-ups of up to \$10\textasciicircum 5\$ over full simulations. This computationally opens up the stability constrained characterization of multi-planet systems. Our model, trained on \$\textbackslash approx 100,000\$ three-planet systems sampled at discrete resonances, generalizes both to a sample spanning a continuous period-ratio range, as well as to a large five-planet sample with qualitatively different configurations to our training dataset. Our approach significantly outperforms previous methods based on systems' angular momentum deficit, chaos indicators, and parametrized fits to numerical integrations. We use SPOCK to constrain the free eccentricities between the inner and outer pairs of planets in the Kepler-431 system of three approximately Earth-sized planets to both be below 0.05. Our stability analysis provides significantly stronger eccentricity constraints than currently achievable through either radial velocity or transit duration measurements for small planets, and within a factor of a few of systems that exhibit transit timing variations (TTVs). Given that current exoplanet detection strategies now rarely allow for strong TTV constraints (Hadden et al., 2019), SPOCK enables a powerful complementary method for precisely characterizing compact multi-planet systems. We publicly release SPOCK for community use.},

  abstract = {We construct an analytic model for the gas accretion rate onto planets embedded in protoplanetary disks as a function of planetary mass, viscosity, scale height, and unperturbed surface density, and systematically study the long-term accretion and final masses of gas giant planets. We first derive an analytical formula for the surface density profile near the planetary orbit from considerations of the balance of force and dynamical stability. Using it in the empirical formula of normalized gas accretion rate that is derived based on hydrodynamic simulations, we then simulate the mass evolution of gas giant planets in viscously evolving disks. We finally determine the final mass as a function of semimajor axis of the planet. We find that the disk can be divided into three regions characterized by different processes by which the final mass is determined. In the inner region, the planet grows quickly and forms a deep gap to suppress the growth by itself before disk dissipation. The final mass shows the same trend as the mass determined by the viscous condition for gap opening, but is about 10 times larger than that. In the intermediate region, the disk's viscous diffusion limits gas accretion onto planets before deep gap formation. The final mass can be up to the disk mass, when the disk's viscous evolution occurs faster than disk evaporation. In the outer region, planets capture only tiny amounts of gas within the disk lifetime to form Neptune-like planets. We also derive analytic formulae for the final masses in the different regions and the locations of the boundaries, which are helpful to gain a systematic understanding of the masses of gas giant planets.}

If GW190521 is from a quasicircular binary inspiral, then the detected signal is consistent with the merger of two black holes with masses of \$85\textasciicircum\{+21\}\_\{-14\} M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ and \$66\textasciicircum\{+17\}\_\{-18\} M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ (90 \% credible intervals). We infer that the primary black hole mass lies within the gap produced by (pulsational) pair-instability supernova processes, and has only a 0.32 \% probability of being below \$65 M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. We calculate the mass of the remnant to be \$142\textasciicircum\{+28\}\_\{-16\} M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$, which can be considered an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH).

  abstract = {Recent ALMA observations of the protoplanetary disc around HD 169142 reveal a peculiar structure made of concentric dusty rings: a main ring at {$\sim$} 20 au, a triple system of rings at {$\sim$} 55 - 75 au in millimetric continuum emission and a perturbed gas surface density from the 12CO,13CO and C18O (J = 2 - 1) surface brightness profile. In this Letter, we perform three-dimensional numerical simulations and radiative transfer modeling exploring the possibility that two giant planets interacting with the disc and orbiting in resonant locking can be responsible for the origin of the observed dust inner rings structure. We find that in this configuration the dust structure is actually long lived while the gas mass of the disc is accreted onto the star and the giant planets, emptying the inner region. In addition, we also find that the innermost planet is located at the inner edge of the dust ring, and can accrete mass from the disc, generating a signature in the dust ring shape that can be observed in mm ALMA observations.},

  abstract = {Exomoons may play an important role in determining the habitability of worlds outside of our solar system. They can stabilize conditions, alter the climate by breaking tidal locking with the parent star, drive tidal heating, and perhaps even host life themselves. However, the ability of an exoplanet to sustain an exomoon depends on complex tidal interactions. Motivated by this, we make use of simplified tidal lag models to follow the evolution of the separations and orbital and rotational periods in planet, star, and moon systems. We apply these models to known exoplanet systems to assess the potential for these exoplanets to host exomoons. We find that there are at least 36 systems in which an exoplanet in the habitable zone may host an exomoon for longer than one gigayear. This includes Kepler-1625b, an exoplanet with an exomoon candidate, which we determine would be able to retain a Neptune-sized moon for longer than a Hubble time. These results may help provide potential targets for future observation. In many cases, there remains considerable uncertainty in the composition of specific exoplanets. We show the detection (or not) of an exomoon would provide an important constraint on the planet structure due to differences in their tidal response.},

  abstract = {We revisit the problem of secular resonance sweeping during the dissipation of a protoplanetary disk and its possible role in exciting the orbits of primordial asteroids, in the light of recent models of solar system evolution. We develop an integrator that incorporates the gravitational effect of a uniformly (or not) depleting, axisymmetric disk with arbitrary surface density profile; its performance is verified by analytical calculations. The secular response of fictitious asteroids, under perturbations from Jupiter, Saturn and a decaying disk, is thoroughly studied. Note that the existence of a symmetry plane induced by the disk, lifts the inherent degeneracy of the two-planet system, such that the '\$s\_5\$' nodal frequency can also play a major role. We examine different resonant configurations for the planets (2:1, 3:2, 5:3), disk models and depletion scenarios. For every case we compute the corresponding time paths of secular resonances, which show when and where resonance crossing occurs. The excitation of asteroids, particularly in inclination, is studied in the various models and compared to analytical estimates. We find that inclination excitation in excess of \$\textbackslash sim 10\textasciicircum\{\textbackslash circ\}\$ is possible in the asteroid belt, but the nearly uniform spread of \$\textbackslash Delta i\textbackslash sim 20\textasciicircum\{\textbackslash circ\}\$ observed calls for the combined action of secular resonance sweeping with other mechanisms (e.g. scattering by Mars-sized embryos) that would be operating during terrestrial planet formation. Our results are also applicable to extrasolar planetary systems.},

  abstract = {Satellites in low Earth orbits must accurately conserve their orbital eccentricity, since a decrease in perigee of only 5-10\% would cause them to crash. However, these satellites are subject to gravitational perturbations from the Earth's multipole moments, the Moon, and the Sun that are not spherically symmetric and hence do not conserve angular momentum, especially over the tens of thousands of orbits made by a typical satellite. Why then do satellites not crash? We describe a vector-based analysis of the long-term behavior of satellite orbits and apply this to several toy systems containing a single non-Keplerian perturbing potential. If only the quadrupole potential from the Earth's equatorial bulge is present, all near-circular orbits are stable. If only the octupole potential is present, all such orbits are unstable. If only the lunar or solar potential is present, all near-circular orbits with inclinations to the ecliptic exceeding 39 degrees are unstable. We describe the behavior of satellites in the simultaneous presence of all of these perturbations and show that almost all low Earth orbits are stable because of an accidental property of the dominant quadrupole potential. We also relate these results to the phenomenon of Lidov-Kozai oscillations.},

Studies of a blast wave produced from carbon rods and plastic spheres in an argon background gas have been conducted using the Vulcan laser at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. A laser of 1500 J was focused onto these targets, and rear-side observations of an emission front were recorded using a fast-framing camera. The emission front is asymmetrical in shape and tends to a more symmetrical shape as it progresses due to the production of a second shock wave later in time, which pushes out the front of the blast wave. Plastic spheres produce faster blast waves, and the breakthrough of the second shock is visible before the shock stalls. The results are presented to demonstrate this trend, and similar evolution dynamics of experimental and simulation data from the FLASH radiation-hydrodynamics code are observed.}

We then describe 3D Cartesian and 2D cylindrical FLASH MHD simulations that have helped to design and analyze experiments conducted at the Vulcan laser facility. In these experiments, a laser illuminates a carbon rod target placed in a gas-filled chamber. A magnetic field diagnostic (called a Bdot) employing three very small induction coils is used to measure all three components of the magnetic field at a chosen point in space. The simulations have revealed that many fascinating physical processes occur in the experiments. These include megagauss magnetic fields generated by the interaction of the laser with the target via the Biermann battery mechanism, which are advected outward by the vaporized target material but decrease in strength due to expansion and resistivity; magnetic fields generated by an outward expanding shock via the Biermann battery mechanism; and a breakout shock that overtakes the first wave, the contact discontinuity between the target material and the gas, and then the initial expanding shock. Finally, we discuss the validation and predictive science we have done for this experiment with FLASH.}

  abstract = {The universe is permeated by magnetic fields, with strengths ranging from a femtogauss in the voids between the filaments of galaxy clusters to several teragauss in black holes and neutron stars. The standard model behind cosmological magnetic fields is the nonlinear amplification of seed fields via turbulent dynamo to the values observed. We have conceived experiments that aim to demonstrate and study the turbulent dynamo mechanism in the laboratory. Here we describe the design of these experiments through simulation campaigns using FLASH, a highly capable radiation magnetohydrodynamics code that we have developed, and large-scale three-dimensional simulations on the Mira supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory. The simulation results indicate that the experimental platform may be capable of reaching a turbulent plasma state and study dynamo amplification. We validate and compare our numerical results with a small subset of experimental data using synthetic diagnostics.},

  abstract = {We performed three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of planet migration in stratified disks using the Godunov code PLUTO, where the disk is turbulent due to the magnetorotational instability. We study the migration for planets with different planet-star mass ratios q = Mp /Ms . In agreement with previous studies, for the low-mass planet cases (q = 5 \texttimes{} 10\textendash 6 and 10\textendash 5), migration is dominated by random fluctuations in the torque. For a Jupiter-mass planet (q = Mp /Ms = 10\textendash 3 for Ms = 1M {$\Sun$}), we find a reduction of the magnetic stress inside the orbit of the planet and around the gap region. After an initial stage where the torque on the planet is positive, it reverses and we recover migration rates similar to those found in disks where the turbulent viscosity is modeled by an {$\alpha$} viscosity. For the intermediate-mass planets (q = 5 \texttimes{} 10\textendash 5, 10\textendash 4, and 2 \texttimes{} 10\textendash 4), we find a new and so far unexpected behavior. In some cases they experience sustained and systematic outward migration for the entire duration of the simulation. For this case, the horseshoe region is resolved and torques coming from the corotation region can remain unsaturated due to the stresses in the disk. These stresses are generated directly by the magnetic field. The magnitude of the horseshoe drag can overcome the negative Lindblad contribution when the local surface density profile is flat or increasing outward, which we see in certain locations in our simulations due to the presence of a zonal flow. The intermediate-mass planet is migrating radially outward in locations where there is a positive gradient of a pressure bump (zonal flow).},

  abstract = {Dust particles need to grow efficiently from micrometre sizes to thousands of kilometres to form planets. With the growth of millimetre to meter sizes being hindered by a number of barriers, the recent discovery that dust evolution is able to create `self-induced' dust traps shows promises. The condensation and sublimation of volatile species at certain locations, called snow lines, is also thought to be an important part of planet formation scenarios. Given that dust sticking properties change across a snow line, this raises the question: how do snow lines affect the self-induced dust trap formation mechanism? The question is particularly relevant with the multiple observations of the carbon monoxide (CO) snow line in protoplanetary discs, since its effect on dust growth and dynamics is yet to be understood. In this paper, we present the effects of snow lines in general on the formation of self-induced dust traps in a parameter study, then focus on the CO snow line. We find that for a range of parameters, a dust trap forms at the snow line where the dust accumulates and slowly grows, as found for the water snow line in previous work. We also find that, depending on the grains sticking properties on either side of the CO snow line, it could either be a starting or braking point for dust growth and drift. This could provide clues to understand the link between dust distributions and snow lines in protoplanetary disc observations.},

  abstract = {The most distant known trans-Neptunian objects (perihelion distance above 38 au and semimajor axis above 150 au) are of interest for their potential to reveal past, external, or present but unseen perturbers. Realizing this potential requires understanding how the known planets influence their orbital dynamics. We use a recently-developed Poincare mapping approach for orbital phase space studies of the circular planar restricted three body problem, which we have extended to the case of the three-dimensional restricted problem with N planetary perturbers. With this approach, we explore the dynamical landscape of the 23 most distant TNOs under the perturbations of the known giant planets. We find that, counter to common expectations, almost none of these TNOs are far removed from Neptune's resonances. Nearly half (11) of these TNOs have orbits consistent with stable libration in Neptune's resonances; in particular, the orbits of TNOs 148209 and 474640 overlap with Neptune's 20:1 and 36:1 resonances, respectively. Five objects can be ruled currently non-resonant, despite their large orbital uncertainties, because our mapping approach determines the resonance boundaries in angular phase space in addition to semimajor axis. Only three objects are in orbital regions not appreciably affected by resonances: Sedna, 2012 VP113 and 2015 KG163. Our analysis also demonstrates that Neptune's resonances impart a modest (few percent) non-uniformity in the longitude of perihelion distribution of the currently observable distant TNOs. While not large enough to explain the observed clustering, this small dynamical sculpting of the perihelion longitudes could become relevant for future, larger TNO datasets.},

  abstract = {In circumstellar discs, collisional grinding of planetesimals produces second-generation dust. While it remains unclear whether this ever becomes a major component of the total dust content, the presence of such dust, and potentially the substructure within, it can be used to explore a disc's physical conditions. A perturbing planet produces nonaxisymmetric structures and gaps in the dust, regardless of its origin. The dynamics of planetesimals, however, will be very different than that of small dust grains due to weaker gas interactions. Therefore, planetesimal collisions could create dusty disc structures that would not exist otherwise. In this work, we use N-body simulations to investigate the collision rate profile of planetesimals near mean-motion resonances. We find that a distinct bump or dip feature is produced in the collision profile, the presence of which depends on the libration width of the resonance and the separation between the peri- and apocenter distances of the edges of the resonance. The presence of one of these two features depends on the mass and eccentricity of the planet. Assuming that the radial dust emission traces the planetesimal collision profile, the presence of a bump or dip feature in the dust emission at the 2:1 mean-motion resonance can constrain the orbital properties of the perturbing planet. This assumption is valid, so long as radial drift does not play a significant role during the collisional cascade process. Under this assumption, these features in the dust emission should be marginally observable in nearby protoplanetary disks with ALMA.},

We present homogenous Doppler tomographic analyses of eight datasets, including two new datasets from TS23 and HIDES, obtained between 2008 and 2019, to illustrate the variations in the projected spin-orbit obliquity of WASP-33b and its impact parameter. We also present its impact parameters based on photometric transit observations captured by MuSCAT in 2017 and MuSCAT2 in 2018. We derived its real spin-orbit obliquity {$\psi$}, stellar spin inclination i\textsubscript{s}, and stellar gravitational quadrupole moment J{$_2$} from the time variation models of the two orbital parameters. We obtained {$\psi$}= 108.19\textsuperscript{+0.95}\textsubscript{-0.97} deg, i\textsubscript{s} = 58.3\textsuperscript{+4.6}\textsubscript{-4.2} deg, and J{$_2$}=(1.36\textsuperscript{+0.15}\textsubscript{-0.12}) \texttimes 10{$^{-4}$}. Our J{$_2$} value was slightly smaller than the theoretically predicted value, which may indicate that its actual stellar internal structure is different from the theoretical one.

In this sample, we find that planets within a single multi-planet system have correlated sizes: each planet is more likely to be the size of its neighbor than a size drawn at random from the distribution of observed planet sizes. In systems with three or more planets, the planets tend to have a regular spacing: the orbital period ratios of adjacent pairs of planets are correlated. Furthermore, the orbital period ratios are smaller in systems with smaller planets, suggesting that the patterns in planet sizes and spacing are linked through formation and/or subsequent orbital dynamics. Yet, we find that essentially no planets have orbital period ratios smaller than \$1.2\$, regardless of planet size. Using empirical mass-radius relationships, we estimate the mutual Hill separations of planet pairs. We find that \$93\textbackslash\%\$ of the planet pairs are at least 10 mutual Hill radii apart, and that a spacing of \$\textbackslash sim20\$ mutual Hill radii is most common. We also find that when comparing planet sizes, the outer planet is larger in \$65 \textbackslash pm 0.4\textbackslash\%\$ of cases, and the typical ratio of the outer to inner planet size is positively correlated with the temperature difference between the planets. This could be the result of photo-evaporation.},

  abstract = {Characterizing the physical properties and compositions of circumplanetary disks can provide important insights into the formation of giant planets and satellites. We report ALMA 0.88 mm (Band 7) continuum observations of six planetary-mass (10-20 \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm Jup\}\$) companions: CT Cha b, 1RXS 1609 b, ROXs 12 b, ROXs 42B b, DH Tau b, and FU Tau b. No continuum sources are detected at the locations of the companions down to 3\$\textbackslash sigma\$ limits of 120-210 \$\textbackslash mu\$Jy. Given these non-detections, it is not clear whether disks around planetary-mass companions indeed follow the disk flux-host mass trend in the stellar regime. The faint radio brightness of these companion disks may result from a combination of fast radial drift and a lack of dust traps. Alternatively, as disks in binary systems are known to have significantly lower millimeter fluxes due to tidal interactions, these companion disks may instead follow the relationship of moderate-separation binary stars. This scenario can be tested with sensitive continuum imaging at rms levels of \$\textbackslash lesssim\$10 \$\textbackslash mu\$Jy.},

  abstract = {Recent observations of Kepler multi-planet systems have revealed a number of systems with planets very close to second-order mean motion resonances (MMRs, with period ratio \$1:3\$, \$3:5\$, etc.) We present an analytic study of resonance capture and its stability for planets migrating in gaseous disks. Resonance capture requires slow convergent migration of the planets, with sufficiently large eccentricity damping timescale \$T\_e\$ and small pre-resonance eccentricities. We quantify these requirements and find that they can be satisfied for super-Earths under protoplanetary disk conditions. For planets captured into resonance, an equilibrium state can be reached, in which eccentricity excitation due to resonant planet-planet interaction balances eccentricity damping due to planet-disk interaction. We show that this "captured" equilibrium can be overstable, leading to partial or permanent escape of the planets from the resonance. In general, the stability of the captured state depends on the inner to outer planet mass ratio \$q=m\_1/m\_2\$ and the ratio of the eccentricity damping times. The overstability growth time is of order \$T\_e\$, but can be much larger for systems close to the stability threshold. For low-mass planets undergoing type I (non-gap opening) migration, convergent migration requires \$q \textbackslash lesssim 1\$, while the stability of the capture requires \$q\textbackslash gtrsim 1\$. These results suggest that planet pairs stably captured into second-order MMRs have comparable masses. This is in contrast to first-order MMRs, where a larger parameter space exists for stable resonance capture. We confirm and extend our analytical results with \$N\$-body simulations, and show that for overstable capture, the escape time from the MMR can be comparable to the time the planets spend migrating between resonances.},

  abstract = {A number of multiplanet systems are observed to contain planets very close to mean motion resonances, although there is no significant pileup of precise resonance pairs. We present theoretical and numerical studies on the outcome of capture into first-order mean motion resonances (MMRs) using a parametrized planet migration model that takes into account nonlinear eccentricity damping due to planet-disk interaction. This parametrization is based on numerical hydrodynamical simulations and is more realistic than the simple linear parametrization widely used in previous analytic studies. We find that nonlinear eccentricity damping can significantly influence the stability and outcome of resonance capture. In particular, the equilibrium eccentricity of the planet captured into MMRs become larger, and the captured MMR state tends to be more stable compared to the prediction based on the simple migration model. In addition, when the migration is sufficiently fast or/and the planet mass ratio is sufficiently small, we observe a novel phenomenon of eccentricity overshoot, where the planet's eccentricity becomes very large before settling down to the lower equilibrium value. This can lead to the ejection of the smaller planet if its eccentricity approaches unity during the overshoot. This may help explain the lack of low-mass planet companion of hot Jupiters when compared to warm Jupiters.},

The standard result, Sc=1+tstop/teddy, in terms of the eddy turnover time, teddy, is shown to be incorrect. The main difference is that Sc rises quadratically, not linearly, with stopping time. Consequently, particles larger than {$\sim$}10 cm in protoplanetary disks will suffer less radial diffusion and will settle closer to the midplane. Such a layer of boulders would be more prone to gravitational collapse. Our predictions of RMS speeds, vertical scale height and diffusion coefficients will help interpret numerical simulations. We confirm previous results for the vertical stirring of particles (scale heights and random velocities), and add a correction for arbitrary ratios of eddy to orbital times. The particle layer becomes thinner for teddy{$>$}1/{$\Omega$} with the strength of turbulent diffusion held fixed.

  abstract = {Interpenetrating streams of solids and gas in a Keplerian disk produce a local, linear instability. The two components mutually interact via aerodynamic drag, which generates radial drift and triggers unstable modes. The secular instability does not require self-gravity, yet it generates growing particle-density perturbations that could seed planetesimal formation. Growth rates are slower than dynamical but faster than radial drift timescales. Growth rates, like streaming velocities, are maximized for marginal coupling (stopping times comparable to dynamical times). Fastest growth occurs when the solid-to-gas density ratio is order unity and feedback is strongest. Curiously, growth is strongly suppressed when the densities are too nearly equal. The relation between background drift and wave properties is explained by analogy with Howard's semicircle theorem. The three-dimensional, two-fluid equations describe a sixth-order (in the complex frequency) dispersion relation. A terminal velocity approximation allows simplification to an approximate cubic dispersion relation. To describe the simplest manifestation of this instability, we ignore complicating (but possibly relevant) factors such as vertical stratification, dispersion of particle sizes, turbulence, and self-gravity. We consider applications to planetesimal formation and compare our work to other studies of particle-gas dynamics.},

As the orbit shrinks, it becomes more eccentric until, by the time its semimajor axis has shrunk by a factor of 4, its eccentricity reaches nearly unity (1 [ e {$>$} 10\textasciitilde 4). In typical planetary systems, bodies in this higheccentricity phase are likely to be consumed by the central star.

  abstract = {It is often assumed that the "Kepler dichotomy" \textendash{} the apparent excess of planetary systems with a single detected transiting planet in the Kepler catalog \textendash{} reflects an intrinsic bimodality in the mutual inclinations of planetary orbits. After conducting 600 simulations of planet formation followed by simulated Kepler observations, we instead propose that the apparent dichotomy reflects a divergence in the amount of migration and the separation of planetary semimajor axes into distinct "clusters". We find that our simulated high-mass systems migrate rapidly, bringing more planets into orbital periods of less than 200 days. The outer planets are often caught in a migration trap \textendash{} a range of planet masses and locations in which a dominant co-rotation torque prevents inward migration \textendash{} which splits the system into two clusters. If clusters are sufficiently separated, the inner cluster remains dynamically cold, leading to low mutual inclinations and a higher probability of detecting multiple transiting planets. Conversely, our simulated low-mass systems typically bring fewer planets inside 200 days, forming a single cluster that quickly becomes dynamically unstable, leading to collisions and high mutual inclinations. We propose an alternative explanation for the apparent Kepler dichotomy in which migration traps during formation lead to fewer planets inside the Kepler detection window, and where mutual inclinations play only a secondary role. If our scenario is correct, then Kepler's STIPs (Systems with Tightly-packed Inner Planets) are a sample of planets that escaped capture by co-rotation traps, and their sizes may be a valuable probe into the structure of protoplanetary discs.},

Analysis of the continuum data indicates that 80\% of the dust mass is concentrated in an annulus extending between 79 and 114 AU in radius. Dust is robustly detected inside the annulus, at a mass surface density 100 times lower than that at 80 AU. The CO emission in the inner disk also shows a significantly decreased mass surface density, but we infer a cavity radius of only 31 AU for the gas. The large separation of the dust and gas cavity edges, as well as the high radial concentration of millimeter-sized dust grains, is qualitatively consistent with the predictions of pressure trap models that include hydrodynamical disk-planet interactions and dust coagulation/fragmentation processes.},

We investigate how the disk's self-gravity affects the gap formation process and the migration of the giant planet. Two series of 1-D and 2-D hydrodynamic simulations are performed. We select several surface densities and focus on the gravitationally stable region. To obtain more reliable gravity torques exerted on the planet, a refined treatment of disk's gravity is adopted in the vicinity of the planet. Our results indicate that the net effect of the disk's self-gravity on the gap formation process depends on the surface density of the disk. We notice that there are two critical values, \textbackslash Sigma\_I and \textbackslash Sigma\_II. When the surface density of the disk is lower than the first one, \textbackslash Sigma\_0 {$<$} \textbackslash Sigma\_I, the effect of self-gravity suppresses the formation of a gap. When \textbackslash Sigma\_0 {$>$} \textbackslash Sigma\_I, the self-gravity of the gas tends to benefit the gap formation process and enlarge the width/depth of the gap. According to our 1-D and 2-D simulations, we estimate the first critical surface density \textbackslash Sigma\_I \textbackslash approx 0.8MMSN. This effect increases until the surface density reaches the second critical value \textbackslash Sigma\_II. When \textbackslash Sigma\_0 {$>$} \textbackslash Sigma\_II, the gravitational turbulence in the disk becomes dominant and the gap formation process is suppressed again. Our 2-D simulations show that this critical surface density is around 3.5MMSN. We also study the associated orbital evolution of a giant planet. Under the effect of the disk's self-gravity, the migration rate of the giant planet increases when the disk is dominated by gravitational turbulence. We show that the migration timescale associates with the effective viscosity and can be up to 10\textasciicircum 4 yr.},

In rapid rotators, angular momentum transported from the contracting core to the expanding envelope can spin-up the surface layers past the break-up rate, particularly for stars near (or beyond) the end of the main-sequence and in low-metallicity environments. We also demonstrate that centrifugal instabilities could arise in rapidly rotating massive stars, potentially triggering the S Doradus outbursts observed in luminous blue variable stars. Prior mass accretion from a binary companion increases both the likelihood and the intensity of centrifugal mass-loss.

Previous studies have suggested that planet-induced spiral arms cannot explain these spiral patterns, as 1) the pitch angle of the spiral arm is larger in observations than that predicted by the linear density wave theory, 2) the contrast of the spiral arm is higher in observations than in synthetic observations based on two dimensional planet-disk simulations. We have carried out three dimensional (3-D) hydrodynamical simulations to study spiral wakes/shocks excited by young planets. We find that, in contrast with linear theory, the pitch angle of spiral arms does depend on the planet mass, which can be explained by the non-linear density wave theory. The more massive is the planet, the larger pitch angle the spiral arm has. A secondary spiral arm, especially for the inner arms, is also excited by the planet. The more massive is the planet, the larger is the separation in the azimuthal direction between the primary and secondary arms. We also find that although the arms in the outer disk do not exhibit much vertical motion, the inner arms have significant vertical motion, which boosts the density perturbation at the disk atmosphere by more than a factor of 10 compared with that at the disk midplane. Combining hydrodynamical models with Monte-Carlo radiative transfer calculations, we find that the inner spiral arms are considerably more prominent in synthetic near-IR images using full 3-D hydrodynamical models than images based on 2-D models, indicating the need to model observations with full 3-D hydrodynamics. Overall, spiral arms (especially inner arms) excited by planetary-mass objects are prominent features that are observable by current near-IR imaging facilities, and the shape of the spiral arms informs us not only about the position but also about the mass of the companion.},

We find that cold Jupiters appear three times more often around hosts of super Earths than they do around field stars. Given the prevalence of the super Earth systems, their cold Jupiters can account for nearly all cold Jupiters. In other words, cold Jupiters are almost certainly ({$\sim$}90\%) accompanied by super Earths. A few corollaries follow: (1) around metal-rich ([Fe/H] {$>$} 0.1) stars, the fraction of super Earths with cold Jupiters can rise to 60\% or higher; (2) the inner architecture can be strongly impacted by the outer giant and we report some observational evidence for this; (3) planetary systems like our own, with cold Jupiters but no super Earths, should be rare ({$\sim$}1\%). The strong correlation between super Earths and cold Jupiters establish that super Earths and cold Jupiters do not compete for solid material, rather, they share similar origins, with the cold Jupiter formation requiring a somewhat more stringent condition.

  abstract = {Spirals in protoplanetary discs have been used to locate the potential planet in discs. Since only the spiral shape from a circularly orbiting perturber is known, most previous works assume that the planet is in a circular orbit. We develop a simple semi-analytical method to calculate the shape of the spirals launched by an eccentric planet. We assume that the planet emits wavelets during its orbit, and the wave fronts of these propagating wavelets form the spirals. The resulting spiral shape from this simple method agrees with numerical simulations exceptionally well. The spirals excited by an eccentric planet can detach from the planet, bifurcate, or even cross each other, which are all reproduced by this simple method. The spiral's bifurcation point corresponds to the wavelet that is emitted when the planet's radial speed reaches the disc's sound speed. Multiple spirals can be excited by an eccentric planet (more than 5 spirals when e0.2). The pitch angle and pattern speed are different between different spirals and can vary significantly across one spiral. The spiral wakes launched by high-mass eccentric planets steepen to spiral shocks and the crossing of spiral shocks leads to distorted or broken spirals. With the same mass, a more eccentric planet launches weaker spirals and induces a shallower gap over a long period of time. The observed unusually large/small pitch angles of some spirals, the irregular multiple spirals, and the different pattern speeds between different spirals may suggest the existence of eccentric perturbers in protoplanetary discs.},

  abstract = {Despite that many methods have been developed to find young massive planets in protoplanetary discs, it is still challenging to directly detect low-mass planets that are embedded in discs. On the other hand, the core-accretion theory suggests that there could be a large population of embedded low-mass young planets at the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) contraction phase. We adopt both 1-D models and 3-D simulations to calculate the envelope structure around low-mass cores (several to tens of M\textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}) with different luminosities, and derive their thermal fluxes at radio wavelengths. We find that, when the disc is optically thin at these wavelengths, the observation can see through the disc and probe the denser envelope within the planet's Hill sphere. When the optically thin disc is observed with the resolution reaching one disc scale height, the radio thermal flux from the planetary envelope around a 10 M\textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} core is more than 10\% higher than the flux from the background disc. The emitting region can be extended and elongated. Finally, our model suggests that the au-scale excess detected by ALMA at 52 au in TW Hydrae disc is consistent with the envelope of an embedded 10-20 M\textsubscript{{$\oplus$}} planet, which can explain the detected flux, the spectral index dip, and the tentative spirals. The observation is also consistent with the planet undergoing pebble accretion. Future ALMA and ngVLA observations may directly reveal more such low-mass planets, enabling us to study core growth and even reconstruct the planet formation history using the "protoplanet" population.},
